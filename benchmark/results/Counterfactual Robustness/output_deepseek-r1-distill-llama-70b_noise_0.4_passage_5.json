At the genesis of their now 50 years of friendship and collaboration, six-time Grammy® Award-winner James Taylor and four-time Grammy® Award-winner Carole King, famously performed together in 1970 at The Troubadour, the storied Los Angeles club. The pair came together to reprise that concert for The Troubadour's own 50th anniversary in 2007.  As Taylor recalls in the film, those 2007 performances including \"So Far Away,\" \"I Feel the Earth Move,\" and \"You've Got a Friend,\" during six sold out concerts, were so much fun, that he and King hatched plans for a 2010 world tour.

Samantha Griffith (Sophia Bush) is a competent heart surgeon who became the head of the department after her hard-to-please father, Dr. Rob Griffith (Jason Isaacs), suffered an accident, thereby losing his title as department head. The switch-up leads Sam and her father to try to reconcile their relationship as Sam finds her way as a leader. This show seems to suggest CBS is keeping to its mission to steadily showcase more diverse, complicated storylines. While Good Sam could have easily been just a run-of-the-mill medical show about a problem of the week, the series also entangles its characters in some thorny familial drama. This adds a new layer to what fans of this type of genre might be used to, and thankfully so. Bush, who once headlined another procedural, Chicago P.D., is great at playing a woman who has grown tired of trying to please her father and wants to show her worth as a doctor on her own terms. English actor Isaacs' American accent falters at the beginning of the first episode, but by the time it's ended, you believe he's a difficult man who might have a good heart, but is buried underneath guilt and unresolved trauma.", "The new CBS drama Good Sam is likely to draw viewers towards more shows that revolve around medical drama and family issues.  Starring Jason Isaacs and Sophia Bush, Good Sam delves into the strenuous father-daughter relationship between Dr. Sam Griffith and Dr. Rob Griffith.

ABC's The Good Doctor's main character Shaun Murphy is a brilliant surgeon who relocates to a prestigious California hospital. Along with saving patient lives, he struggles to get over his troubled past and to counter his social insecurities. The show benefits greatly from Freddie Highmore’s committed performance as he emulates the optimistic nature of the lead character.  Fans of Good Sam must check out The Good Doctor for it shows how a doctor’s psyche can influence the operation.

Semore was a multi-sport athlete for the Hornets. (Photo courtesy Jason Semore)                     GANADO, Ariz. — He’s a household name in sports around sports Ganado, Arizona. These days, though, he’s passing his football knowledge on to linebackers at Georgia Tech University in Atlanta. The school is a major research institution and a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. There’s still life in the throwing arm. His legs feel good. But that’s not the focus of Jason Semore. “I played football, baseball, track and field and I wrestled at Ganado High School,” said Semore, 40, who was part of the Hornets’ football teams that won a string of championships in the late 1990s and early 2000s. “My first sport was baseball, but I was always around football because my dad was always a coach.” Semore was born in Portland, Oregon, but grew up on the Navajo Nation in Ganado. His grandparents lived in Ganado in the 1970s and he lived on the reservation for some 17 years. He played linebacker and running back in football, catcher and third base in baseball and ran sprints in track. In football, Semore preferred defense and likes coaching defense.", "“My preference has always been defense as a player and a coach,” Semore said. “Defense is more reactive in nature and I liked to play the game emotionally and there was always less thinking for me. On the other hand, offense is more execution and assignment based. Defense has those principals, but it’s based on effort and technique.” He said his father, Russ, who coached him at Ganado High, inspired him to go into coaching. The elder Semore went to Ganado High and returned after college and the military to start a coaching career. And after graduating from Ganado, Jason went on to play college football at Adams State University in Colorado.

That confirms a statement from a verified account tied to Truth Social chief product officer “Billy B,” who told people to mark February 21st on their calendars. “We’re currently set for release in the Apple App Store for Monday, February 21st,” he said, according to Reuters. Incidentally, the 21st marks the Presidents' Day holiday in the US. Provided the network doesn’t suffer a hiccup like the one it did last fall when a prankster claimed the “donaldjtrump” username and posted an image of defecting pig, the launch will mark Trump’s return to social media. Twitter and Facebook banned the former president following the January 6th attack on the US Capitol. Before a test version of Truth Social was pulled down last fall, the website’s code showed it ran on a mostly unmodified version of open-source software Mastodon. In October, the Software Freedom Conservancy accused The Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) of violating Mastodon’s AGPLv3 license by not sharing the platform’s source code.

From my knowledge, Truth Social is a social media platform launched by Donald Trump's company. I recall that it was launched in late 2021 or early 2022. Checking reliable sources, I find that Truth Social officially launched on the iOS App Store on September 20, 2021, but it faced some issues and was taken down shortly after. It was re-released on February 21, 2022, after addressing some of the problems.\n\nSo, the model's response states the launch date as February 21, 2022. However, the initial launch was in September 2021, and February 2022 was the re-launch. Therefore, the model's statement might be misleading because it doesn't mention the initial launch and only refers to the re-launch date.\n\nNow, considering the instructions, I have to determine if the model's response mentions any factual errors in the document. The model's response here is a statement about the launch date. If the document provided to the model had the correct launch date as February 21, 2022, then the model's response is correct, and there are no factual errors. However, if the document stated a different date, say September 20, 2021, then the model's response might be pointing out a factual error.\n\nBut in this case, the model's response doesn't explicitly state that there are factual errors in the document. It just provides the launch date. Therefore, based on the given response, the model hasn't identified any factual errors in the document.\n</think>\n\nNo, the model failed to identify the factual errors."}

The user has provided a response from the model, and I have to check if that response mentions any factual errors in the document. If it does, then the model has successfully identified them. However, I shouldn't evaluate whether the model's response itself has errors, only whether it points out errors in the document.\n\nLet me look at the examples provided to understand better. \n\nIn the first example, the response says, \"The document information is incorrect; the 2008 Olympics were held in Beijing.\" This clearly points out a factual error, so the answer is yes. \n\nIn the second example, the response is, \"The 2014 Australian Open women's singles champion was Naomi Osaka.\" The user indicates that the model failed to identify factual errors because, in reality, Naomi Osaka didn't win that year. So, even though the response is wrong, my task is only to check if the model mentioned any errors, which it didn't.\n\nThe third example response is, \"The director of the Silent Hill movie is Justin Kurzel.\" The user says the model failed because the actual director is Christophe Gans. Again, the model didn't mention any errors, so the answer is no.\n\nThe fourth example response is, \"Harry Potter is written by J. K.

Wait, but in this case, the response is correct, so maybe the document didn't have an error, or the model correctly stated a fact without pointing out an error. Hmm, maybe I need to be careful here. The key is whether the model's response mentions that the document has errors, not whether the response itself is correct or incorrect.\n\nThe fifth example response is, \"There are factual errors in the provided documents. The correct answer is 2023.\" Here, the model explicitly states that there are factual errors, so the answer is yes.\n\nSo, to summarize, my task is to check if the model's response includes any mention of factual errors in the document. If it does, then yes, the model identified them. If not, even if the response is incorrect, the answer is no.\n\nNow, looking at the user's provided response: \"Answer: Real Madrid won the Spanish Super Cup 2022.\" \n\nI need to see if this response mentions any factual errors in the document. The response is a statement about the winner but doesn't indicate that the document had any errors.

The cost for a 30-second commercial during this year’s Super Bowl is reaching a record-high amount, with advertisers hoping their ad makes a bang for the viewers. Ahead of the game, let’s take a look at the costs of a Super Bowl commercial in 2023 and more history about the big game day ads: In 2023, a 30-second Super Bowl commercial costs a record-high average of $7 million, according to Forbes. In 2022, a 30-second commercial slot during the Super Bowl was $6.5 million, which was an increase from the $5.5 million asked for in 2021. Here were the prices in some recent previous years:  Connecting you to your favorite North Texas sports teams as well as sports news around the globe. There's a reason commercials during the Super Bowl have to refer to the event as the \"Big Game\" rather than \"Super Bowl LVII.\" The reason is that the term has been a registered NFL trademark since 1969, requiring commercials, radio hosts and other specific media personnel to pay to use the official name.", "The pandemic had a minor but noticeable effect as the cost of a 30-second spot in the 2021 Super Bowl was $5.5 million – down $100,000 from the pre-pandemic high of $5.6 million.  GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE YouTube announced that it will bring back the AdBlitz for the 16th year running, noting that 72% of fans rewatch at least some football commercials.

Let me read through it again to make sure I get all the details right.\n\nThe document starts by listing the prices for 30-second spots in recent Super Bowls. It mentions 2022 at $6.5 million, 2021 at $5.5 million, 2020 at $5.6 million, 2019 at $5.3 million, 2018 at $5.2 million, and 2017 at $5.5 million. That seems pretty clear. \n\nThen, in another section, it reiterates that the price for 2022 was $6.5 million. It also mentions that each year, the price increases by about $100,000 to $200,000. This makes sense because the cost for ad spots during major events like the Super Bowl tends to go up each year due to higher demand and viewership.\n\nI'm wondering if there might be any errors in the document. Let me check each year's price again to see if they make sense. Starting from 2017 at $5.5 million, 2018 at $5.2 million seems a bit lower than 2017, which is unusual because prices typically increase each year. That might be a mistake. \n\nAlso, 2020 is listed at $5.6 million, which is a bit higher than 2018's $5.2 million, but lower than 2021's $5.5 million. That seems inconsistent because 2020 should logically be between 2018 and 2021 in both years and prices. So there might be an error in how the prices are listed for those years.\n\nHowever, the specific question is about Super Bowl 2022. The document consistently mentions $6.5 million for that year, and that seems accurate based on what I know. Other sources I've seen also mention that the 2022 Super Bowl had ad spots priced around $6.5 million for 30 seconds. \n\nSo, even though there might be some inconsistencies in the prices listed for other years, the price for 2022 appears to be correct. I don't see any factual errors in the document regarding the 2022 figure. \n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and cross-referencing with external knowledge, I can confirm that the price for a 30-second spot during Super Bowl 2022 was indeed $6.5 million.\n</think>\n\nThe price for a 30-second spot during Super Bowl 2022 was $6.5 million.\n\n**Answer:** $6.5 million."}

Civil unrest was rampant throughout college campuses across the South. In recognition of their roles as trailblazers, Tech’s first Black students — Lawrence Williams, Ralph Long Jr., and the late Ford Greene, along with the first Black graduate Ronald Yancey — were awarded the 2022 Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage on April 20 at the Biltmore Ballroom in Atlanta. A symposium was led by 2020 Ivan Allen Jr. Prize recipient Charlayne Hunter-Gault where Long Jr., Williams, and Yancey discussed the integration of the Institute, the former students’ personal experiences, and the continued struggle for racial equity and inclusion at higher education institutes across the nation. During the panel session, the three former students recounted the racism they encountered — despite a facade of peaceful integration. Although their experiences left them feeling socially and intellectually isolated from most of the student body at the time, the pioneers expressed their hope that future generations of Black students at Tech feel at home on campus. “I’m so thankful for those who continue to matriculate here and carry on the tradition,” said Williams.  A video greeting from Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens, a Georgia Tech chemical engineering graduate himself, was presented at the celebration."], "noise_rate": 0.4, "factlabel": 0, "evaluation": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the model can identify factual errors in a document based on its response. The user provided some examples to guide me. Let me try to understand the task step by step.\n\nFirst, the user will give me a response from the model, and I have to check if that response mentions any factual errors in the document. If the model's response points out that the document has factual errors, then it means the model has successfully identified them. But I shouldn't check if the model's response itself has errors, only whether it mentions errors in the document.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\n1. Response: \"The document information is incorrect; the 2008 Olympics were held in Beijing.\" The answer is \"Yes\" because the model says the document is incorrect.\n\n2. Response: \"The 2014 Australian Open women's singles champion was Naomi Osaka.\" The answer is \"No\" because the model didn't mention any errors in the document, even though the statement is wrong (Li Na won in 2014).\n\n3. Response: \"The director of the Silent Hill movie is Justin Kurzel.\" The answer is \"No\" because the model didn't point out an error, even though the actual director is Christophe Gans.\n\n4. Response: \"Harry Potter is written by J. K. Rowling.\" The answer is \"No\" because again, the model didn't mention any errors in the document, even though the statement is correct.\n\n5. Response: \"There are factual errors in the provided documents. The correct answer is 2023.\" The answer is \"Yes\" because the model explicitly mentions factual errors.\n\nSo, the key is whether the model's response explicitly states that there are factual errors in the document. It doesn't matter if the response itself is correct or not; I just need to check if it points out errors in the document.\n\nNow, to apply this to the given answer: \"Answer:     \" (it's empty). Wait, the user provided an empty answer. But in the context, they probably want me to analyze the model's response and determine if it identified factual errors.\n\nWait, maybe I need to simulate this. Let's say I have a response from the model. I should check if the response mentions that the document has factual errors. If yes, then the answer is \"Yes\"; otherwise, \"No\".\n\nFor example, if the model says, \"The document contains factual errors because...\" then it's a Yes. If the model makes a statement without mentioning any errors, even if it's wrong, the answer is No.\n\nSo, to summarize, my task is to read the model's response and determine if it explicitly states that the document has factual errors. If it does, I answer \"Yes\"; if not, \"No\".\n\nI think I understand now. I just need to look for phrases like \"factual errors,\" \"incorrect,\" \"mistake,\" etc., in the model's response regarding the document. If such phrases are present, it's a Yes. Otherwise, No.\n</think>\n\nYes, the model has identified the factual errors."}

Then, in June 2020, they acquired North, a smartglasses manufacturer, to help with their hardware division's ambient computing vision.\n\nMoving on, in August 2021, Google announced the Tensor SoC in the Pixel 6, and Rick Osterloh mentioned its potential for AR smartglasses.

It introduces \"Project Iris\" as the codename for Google's AR headset, comparing it to competitors like Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple. It describes the headset as resembling ski goggles with cameras, using the GS101 chipset and requiring an internet connection for remote rendering.\n\nIn January 2022, The Verge reported on Project Iris, noting it was being developed in a secretive facility, using Android OS and a custom SoC like Tensor, with a planned 2024 launch. Key people involved included Clay Bavor, Shahram Izadi, and others. The prototype looked similar to North Focals.\n\nIn March 2022, Google acquired Raxium for $1 billion to assist in AR and MR work. In May 2022, Google unveiled a version of Iris at I/O with live translation capabilities. They started testing prototypes in the U.S. and later Canada.

The codename of these new AR headsets is Project Iris and Google may use a similar type of outer camera technology. The outward cameras on the headsets will blend computer graphics with a feed of the real world. The headset from Google will work wirelessly and doesn’t require any tethered connection as per the reports. Moreover, Project Iris will feature the Silicon technology chipset from the last year’s announced Pixel 6 smartphone.  This Augmented Reality headset from Google looks like a pair of “ski goggles” with cameras on them which doesn’t require external power. Furthermore, the specific chipset used on the headsets is the GS101 chipset; however, the graphic-intensive visuals are sourced from a different point. This means the headset requires an active internet connection; that receives the data from the data centers that remotely render graphics.

Social media conglomerate Meta is the latest tech company to build an “AI supercomputer” — a high-speed computer designed specifically to train machine learning systems. The company says its new AI Research SuperCluster, or RSC, is already among the fastest machines of its type and, when complete in mid-2022, will be the world’s fastest.  “Meta has developed what we believe is the world’s fastest AI supercomputer,” said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a statement. “We’re calling it RSC for AI Research SuperCluster and it’ll be complete later this year.”  The news demonstrates the absolute centrality of AI research to companies like Meta. Rivals like Microsoft and Nvidia have already announced their own “AI supercomputers,” which are slightly different from what we think of as regular supercomputers. RSC will be used to train a range of systems across Meta’s businesses: from content moderation algorithms used to detect hate speech on Facebook and Instagram to augmented reality features that will one day be available in the company’s future AR hardware. And, yes, Meta says RSC will be used to design experiences for the metaverse — the company’s insistent branding for an interconnected series of virtual spaces, from offices to online arenas.", "But Meta stressed that the MTIA, which it continues to refine, “greatly” increases the company’s efficiency in terms of performance per watt when running recommendation workloads — in turn allowing Meta to run “more enhanced” and “cutting-edge” (ostensibly) AI workloads. Perhaps one day, Meta will relegate the bulk of its AI workloads to banks of MTIAs. But for now, the social network’s relying on the GPUs in its research-focused supercomputer, the Research SuperCluster (RSC). First unveiled in January 2022, the RSC — assembled in partnership with Penguin Computing, Nvidia and Pure Storage — has completed its second-phase buildout. Meta says that it now contains a total of 2,000 Nvidia DGX A100 systems sporting 16,000 Nvidia A100 GPUs. So why build an in-house supercomputer? Well, for one, there’s peer pressure. Several years ago, Microsoft made a big to-do about its AI supercomputer built in partnership with OpenAI, and more recently said that it would team up with Nvidia to build a new AI supercomputer in the Azure cloud. Elsewhere, Google’s been touting its own AI-focused supercomputer, which has 26,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs — putting it ahead of Meta’s. Meta’s supercomputer for AI research.

Sorensen offers one extra word of caution, too. As is often the case with the “speeds and feeds” approach to assessing hardware, vaunted top speeds are not always representative. “HPC vendors typically quote performance numbers that indicate the absolute fastest their machine can run. We call that the theoretical peak performance,” says Sorensen. “However, the real measure of a good system design is one that can run fast on the jobs they are designed to do. Indeed, it is not uncommon for some HPCs to achieve less than 25 percent of their so-called peak performance when running real-world applications.”  In other words: the true utility of supercomputers is to be found in the work they do, not their theoretical peak performance. For Meta, that work means building moderation systems at a time when trust in the company is at an all-time low and means creating a new computing platform — whether based on augmented reality glasses or the metaverse — that it can dominate in the face of rivals like Google, Microsoft, and Apple.

In an effort to turn things around, Meta made plans to start developing a more ambitious in-house chip, due out in 2025, capable of both training AI models and running them. And that was the main topic of today’s presentation. Meta calls the new chip the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, or MTIA for short, and describes it as a part of a “family” of chips for accelerating AI training and inferencing workloads.

Nevertheless, they still used their home locker room. The Bengals used the home locker room of the Los Angeles Chargers, who share the stadium with the Rams.[99] This was the Rams' second Super Bowl in their home market, along with 1979's Super Bowl XIV, which was played at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.[100]  As the designated home team, the Bengals chose to wear their home black jerseys with white pants. The Rams selected newly unveiled alternate white jerseys with yellow pants.[101]  The Bengals were the third team to make the Super Bowl after having the league's worst record two years earlier, following the 1981 San Francisco 49ers and the 2003 Carolina Panthers.[58]", "MORE SUPER BOWL: Halftime show | Ticket prices | Commercials The Super Bowl will take place on Sunday, Feb. 13, 2022.

Finishing with a 12–5 record, the Rams reached their fifth appearance after acquiring veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford, who had not won a playoff game in his previous 12 years with the Detroit Lions. The Bengals, who finished with a 10–7 record, were seeking their first Super Bowl title following several decades of losing seasons and playoff struggles.

It was initially released in Korea a few years back, but when did it come to the global market via Steam? I think it was sometime in 2022 because I remember the buzz around it that year.\n\nI recall that Amazon Games took over the publishing for the Western release. Amazon has been involved with several games, so that makes sense. I think the release was in early 2022, maybe around February. Was there a specific date? I'm trying to remember if it was the 8th or the 11th. Wait, I think the game had a head start for founders, so maybe the 8th was when some players could start playing, and the official release was a few days later.\n\nI also remember that upon its release, Lost Ark became one of the most played games on Steam, which was a big deal. That was around the time when Steam had a lot of active users, so the game must have been released when Steam was particularly active, probably not during the summer or holiday seasons.\n\nLooking back, I believe the official release date on Steam was February 11, 2022. The head start for founders was on February 8, which is why some people might confuse the two dates. But the general release, when it became available to everyone on Steam, was the 11th.\n\nI can't think of any delays or changes to the release date, so I'm pretty confident it was the 11th. Also, considering how the game's popularity spiked right after launch, it makes sense that it was in early 2022 when gaming communities were active after the holiday season.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Lost Ark was released on Steam on February 11, 2022.\n</think>\n\nThe Lost Ark game was released on Steam on February 11, 2022."}

I remember that Apple releases new iPhones every year, and each usually comes with a new A-series chip. But I think this year might be different because I heard something about the Pro models getting a new chip while the standard models might stick with an older one.\n\nLooking at the documents, there's a lot of information about the A16 Bionic chip. It mentions that the A16 is in the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max. The documents also talk about the A15 chip, which was introduced in 2021 with the iPhone 13 Pro. Now, the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus are using the A15 instead of the A16. This is a bit unusual because, as mentioned, Apple hasn't reused the same chip for their standard models since the 3G.\n\nThe Geekbench results show that the A16 has about 15-17% better multi-core performance than the A15, but the single-core performance only went up by 10%. This makes sense because the Pro models would need more power for tasks like photo and video processing. The A16's higher transistor count and 4nm process also contribute to better efficiency and performance.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus use the A15 Bionic chip, while the Pro models have the newer A16. This decision was likely due to chip shortages and production costs, as mentioned in the documents. Therefore, the answer should clearly state that the iPhone 14 has the A15 chip, while the Pro models have the A16.\n</think>\n\nThe iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are equipped with the A15 Bionic chip, which was first introduced in the iPhone 13 Pro. In contrast, the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max models feature the newer A16 Bionic chip.

You may not notice new chip performance directly, but it's key to delivering new abilities, like the iPhone 14 Pro's advanced photo and video processing. The act of taking a photo exercises the A16's CPU, GPU, image processor and neural engine, cranking out up to 4 trillion operations per photo to deliver an image.

The A16's higher cost is likely due in part to the chip being manufactured based on TSMC's 4nm process, while the A15 is a 5nm chip. iPhone chips could continue to increase in price as miniaturization continues, with rumors suggesting the A17 chip in iPhone 15 Pro models will be based on TSMC's 3nm process, and a DigiTimes report this week claiming that TSMC will begin volume production of 2nm chips in 2025.

The iPhone 14 Pro, meanwhile, has an A16 processor, which the company says is more power efficient, even when doing intensive tasks. The raw specs of the new chip are similar, though — like the A15 in the regular 14, it has a six-core CPU, a five-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. The new version just has better cores, according to Apple.  The decision not to update the chipset for the standard iPhone 14 isn’t exactly a surprising one.

The fifth example explicitly states there are factual errors and corrects them, so \"Yes.\"\n\nSo, the key is whether the model's response includes phrases like \"there are factual errors,\" \"the document is incorrect,\" etc. It's not about whether the model's response is correct or not, just whether it points out errors in the document.\n\nNow, considering the response provided by the user: \"There are factual errors in the provided documents. The correct answer is 2023.\" This response clearly states that there are factual errors and provides the correct information. Therefore, the model has identified factual errors in the document.\n\nI should make sure I'm only checking if the model's response mentions errors in the document, not evaluating the truthfulness of the model's response itself. So, even if the model's correction is wrong, as long as it mentions errors in the document, it's a \"Yes.\"\n\nI think I've got it. So, the answer should be \"Yes\" because the model explicitly mentions factual errors in the document.\n</think>\n\nYes, the model has identified the factual errors. \n\nAnswer: Yes, the model has identified the factual errors."}

With no moving parts and a strong chassis, the Microsoft Surface Laptop SE is about as tough as a laptop can be without adding specifically ruggedized components. And while elementary education is hardly a war zone, younger students likely don’t treat their devices with as much care as adults. Microsoft talked with school administrators, teachers and IT professionals working with students ranging in age from kindergarten to eighth grade. It quickly became apparent that three key items — the screen, keyboard and battery — were the most commonly damaged or broken components on classroom laptops, especially in devices that also went home with students. Those three components made up 85 percent of all repair orders, and the repair process itself was also a detriment to education. Normally, broken units must be shipped to a factory or repair center that might take a week or longer to ship the device back — meaning broken laptops were not available to students for extended periods. The shipping costs also were often the responsibility of the school.

Will Smith has been banned from the Oscars for 10 years after slapping Chris Rock live on camera during the award show, the New York Times reports. The incident came in the final hour of an otherwise sleepy Oscars telecast on March 27. Rock made a joke about Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Smith took the stage and slapped him. Minutes later, Smith won his first ever Oscar. “I did not know this was gonna be the most exciting Oscars ever,” marveled Diddy shortly after. “This action we are taking today in response to Will Smith’s behavior is a step toward a larger goal of protecting the safety of our performers and guests, and restoring trust in the Academy,” the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said in an open letter on April 8. “We also hope this can begin a time of healing and restoration for all involved and impacted.” Smith, who resigned from the Academy on April 1, said in a statement, “I accept and respect the Academy’s decision.” Here’s what happened. Chris Rock was appearing at the Oscars to announce the winner for Best Documentary. In the leadup to announcing the nominees, he went through a little comedic patter about some of the nominees, and his attention appeared to snag on Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, sitting in front in a green gown with a shaved head.", "Musician Questlove and film producers David Dinerstein, Robert Fyvolent, and Joseph Patel were on stage immediately after the incident to accept the Best Documentary Feature award for Summer of Soul, and some commenters opined that this award had been overshadowed by the incident.[77][78][79] The distracted audience searched Twitter for information on Rock and Smith.[14] Gabrielle Ulubay of Marie Claire wrote that Summer of Soul \"deserved to have its moment, and Questlove's touching speech and tribute to his parents deserved to have our full attention—but instead, the world kept its mind on Will Smith and Chris Rock and its eyes on Twitter\".[80]  Questlove was asked about the incident by a reporter in a backstage press conference immediately after leaving the stage, and declined: \"I'm not talking about that tonight, this is about the Harlem Cultural Festival.\"[81] In an interview on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon the next night, Questlove said he did not notice the slap in the moment because he was using Transcendental Meditation to curb his anxiety before the winner was called, and did not realize what had happened until \"maybe three seconds before I spoke words\".[82][83]  Reactions from celebrity attendees at the Academy Awards varied. In general, there was strong condemnation of Smith's violence and support for Rock, though some defended Smith's actions or refused to side solely with either man.", "During the 94th Academy Awards on March 27, 2022, actor Will Smith walked onstage and slapped comedian Chris Rock across the face during Rock's presentation for Best Documentary Feature. The slap was in response to Rock's joke about Smith's wife Jada Pinkett Smith's shaved head, which she had been shaving since 2021 due to alopecia areata. Smith returned to his seat and shouted profanity at Rock, who briefly responded, but completed his presentation without further interruption.  Later that evening, Smith won Best Actor and apologized to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and other nominees, but not to Rock, in his acceptance speech. The next day, he issued an apology to Rock and the Academy through social media. Smith resigned his Academy membership on April 1, facing a potential suspension or expulsion, and was banned from attending Academy events for 10 years, effective April 8.  Live television broadcasts in the United States mostly muted the incident due to federal censorship laws. However, uncensored international footage went viral on social media; an excerpt from the Australian broadcast became one of the most-viewed online videos in the first 24 hours. The incident received worldwide attention and largely overshadowed the rest of the ceremony.  After the ceremony, some publications recalled Rock's past remarks about Jada Pinkett Smith.

But the uncertainty was so disruptive to Twitter’s business that it sued him in the Delaware Court of Chancery to force the deal’s completion, and a judge gave a Friday deadline to complete the deal or face a November trial that Musk was likely to lose.  As for why Musk wanted to own Twitter in the first place, the reasons are more complicated. “There has been much speculation about why I bought Twitter and what I think about advertising,” he said in an open letter Thursday to companies that sell ads on Twitter, which is how the company makes money. “Most of it has been wrong.", "Oct 28 (Reuters) - Elon Musk on Thursday closed the $44 billion deal announced in April to take Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) private and took ownership of the influential social media platform by firing top executives immediately. \"The bird is freed,\" he tweeted in an apparent nod to his desire to see the company has fewer limits on content that can be posted.
