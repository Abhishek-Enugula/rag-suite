Super Bowl LV is Super Bowl 55, which would typically be in 2021. Wait, no, Super Bowl LV was actually in 2021, right? Because Super Bowls are usually in the same year as their numeral. So LV is 55, which is 2021.\n\nLooking further, another part of the document says the game was played on February 7, 2021, at Raymond James Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. That makes sense. Raymond James Stadium is the home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and it's in Tampa, but Glendale is another city in Arizona where the Cardinals play. Wait, no, Raymond James Stadium is in Tampa, Florida. Hmm, maybe I'm confused.\n\nWait, no, the document says the game was played in Glendale, Arizona, at Raymond James Stadium. But I thought Raymond James is in Tampa. Maybe that's a mistake? Or maybe the document is incorrect. Let me check the next part.

But I'm a bit confused because Raymond James is in Tampa. Maybe the document has a mistake, or perhaps they're referring to State Farm Stadium in Glendale instead.
