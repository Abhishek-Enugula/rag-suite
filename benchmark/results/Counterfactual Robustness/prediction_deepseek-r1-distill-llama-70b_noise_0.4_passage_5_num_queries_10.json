Wait, that seems a bit confusing because the French Open is usually in May or June, and Wimbledon is in July. So if she won the French Open in 2018, that would make sense, but she also won Wimbledon in 2019.\n\nThe second document mentions the 2019 Wimbledon Championships, specifically the ladies' singles.

That seems pretty straightforward.\n\nThe third document also states that Romania's Angelique Kerber beat Serena Williams to win the 2019 Wimbledon title in women's singles. Hmm, but I thought Angelique Kerber is German, not Romanian. That might be a mistake in the document.\n\nThe fourth document talks about Carlos Alcaraz winning Wimbledon, but that's related to a men's match, probably from a different year since Alcaraz has been more prominent in recent years, like 2023 maybe.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the consistent information across the first, second, and third documents is that Angelique Kerber won the women's singles at Wimbledon in 2019.
