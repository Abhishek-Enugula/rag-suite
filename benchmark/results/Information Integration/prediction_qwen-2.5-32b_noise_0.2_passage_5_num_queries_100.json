Both of the No. 1 seeds, the Packers and Titans, lost their first game in the divisional round, as all but one of the underdogs won outright. The lone exception was the favored Chiefs, who mounted a game-tying drive with 13 seconds left before winning in overtime. The conference championship games were wild in their own right. Both the Bengals and Rams trailed by double digits in the second half of their wins over the Chiefs and 49ers. They mounted comebacks and as a result, the Bengals will have a chance to win their first Super Bowl in franchise history in their first appearance since 1989.

While the yearly event is primarily targeted at developers, there will be plenty of fun stuff for enthusiasts and the general public. Google usually doesn’t reveal much about what it plans to announce at the event. However, the company has now released the Google I/O 2022 schedule, giving us a brief overview of what to expect. Google I/O 2022 will be held on May 11 and May 12 at the Shoreline Amphitheater. The event will kick off with Sundar Pichai’s “Google I/O keynote” at 10 AM. This will be the main attraction for the general population as the main event tends to be more consumer-focused. While the event’s description doesn’t provide specifics, expect to see announcements for popular Google services, Workspace, privacy, health, and Google’s other new projects and endeavors. Also, keep an eye out for potential hardware announcements in the form of the Pixel 6a, Pixel Watch, and smart home devices. The main keynote will be followed by the Developer keynote and “What’s new in Android.” This is where we expect to learn more about Android 13, Wear OS, and updates to developer products and tools.

The state funeral was one of the United Kingdom's most watched special television broadcasts, surpassing the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the previous most watched royal event of the 21st century. The period of official mourning and the funeral was estimated to have cost the government £162 million.[1]  Queen Elizabeth II was in good health for most of her life; her health, however, declined significantly after the death of her husband, Prince Philip, in April 2021.[2] She began to use a walking stick for public engagements in October 2021.[3] On 20 October, the Queen stayed overnight in King Edward VII's Hospital in central London, necessitating the cancellation of scheduled visits to Northern Ireland and the COP26 summit in Glasgow.

Anil Kashyap explains the rationale for this recognition. This year’s Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences should be thought of as recognizing the research that informs our thinking on three questions about banks: i) Among the many things that banks do, what are the essential features? ii) Why are banks the institutions that perform those functions? iii) What happens when things go wrong in the banking sector? The answers lie in three papers cited by the Nobel committee that all were published in the early 1980s: two theoretical contributions by Diamond and Dybvig (1983) and Diamond (1984); and an empirical contribution by Bernanke (1983). This research shows that the essence of banks is to take deposits that convey services (for example, checking accounts) from savers and use the funds to make loans to households and businesses. In other words, both bank assets (the loans) and liabilities (the deposits) are valuable and you can’t understand banking without recognizing both functions.", "(AP Photo/Michel Euler) Members of the Swedish Academy Chairman of the Committee for Literature Anders Olsson, left, and member of the Nobel Prize Committee for Literature Ellen Mattson speak during the announcement of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Literature, in Borshuset, Stockholm, Sweden, Thursday, Oct. 6, 2022.

However, her role as Adrianna seemingly also confirms the film will feature Isis. In the comics, Adrianna possess the Amulet of Isis, which bestows her with the powers of the goddess. It would make sense for Black Adam to show Adrianna in her superpowered form, perhaps suiting up alongside her husband for an epic battle. Of course, there are bound to be some changes in how Black Adam depicts Adrianna. For one thing, superhero movies these days are always putting some new spins on characters.

In the new Netflix Basic with Ads tier, users can expect around 4-5 minutes of ads per hour. How is this comparable to other Connected TV subscriptions? While the amount of ad time per hour for Netflix is comparable to other streaming services, the lingering issue is when an ad will show. Ad timings are unpredictable, which interrupts the user experience. The video content for ads is about what you expect compared to other streaming services. But the same issue is at hand – when will this show up in a user’s watching experience on Netflix? According to Jay Peters from  The Verge, a user’s ad experience varies dramatically between types of content consumed: As you can see from this example, the amount of ads, as well as the placement of ads, is inconsistent, which leads to believe that Netflix is testing to find the best engagement for not only users but advertisers.

Those who want to watch Netflix on Apple TV must subscribe to one of the more expensive plans without ads. The company never explained why the new ad-based plan is not available in Netflix’s tvOS app. But given the current situation in which Netflix may discontinue the Basic plan without ads, Apple TV users may be forced to subscribe to the more expensive plans if they still want to watch Netflix on the device.

Ironically, Season 1 was filmed amidst the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic when the tourism industry had been facing many setbacks. This gave production designer Laura Fox the opportunity to spend time redesigning the artwork, sets, and scenery in each room featured in the series; The White Lotus fans have enjoyed analyzing the background details for hidden Easter eggs, and Fox herself compared the subtle menace of the hotel to The Shining. Between assassination attempts, mafia, familial conflict, and beautiful Italian scenery, The White Lotus: Sicily had a lot in common with The Godfather. Similar to Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 crime classic, season 2 was filmed on location in Italy. The San Domenico Palace, Taormina stands in for the clifftop resort in the series. Additionally, White makes use of several local wonders, including the Ionian Sea, the Greek Theater of Teatro Antico di Taormina, and the active Mount Etna volcano, which erupts in the final episode, “Arrivederci.” Considering that The White Lotus: Sicily focuses on the issues of colonialism, it makes sense that the series was filmed in a location with a complex history."], "noise_rate": 0.2, "factlabel": 0}

The party will retain control of the chamber, no matter how next month’s Georgia runoff plays out, by virtue of Vice President Kamala Harris’ tiebreaking vote.

It was still unclear which party would control the House of Representatives as counting continued in razor-tight races in California and a smattering of other states.

By Chloe Malle Photography by Norman Jean Roy On the Tuesday evening before her wedding, under the watchful eye of a Secret Service agent, Naomi Biden, 28, and her soon-to-be husband, Peter Neal, 25, came downstairs from their living quarters on the third floor of the White House residence to practice their first dance. The setting was the marble-floored Cross Hall, and Naomi, wearing pajamas and unsure how to work the White House speakers, played Elvis Costello’s “Still”’ on her iPhone as she and her fiancé improvised a casual waltz.  A few days later, at 11 a.m. on Saturday, November 19, the young couple, both lawyers—Naomi at the Washington, DC, firm Arnold & Porter, and Peter at the Georgetown Law Center on National Security—married on a crisp and cloudless day on the South Lawn in front of 250 family members and friends. “We’re so close to our families, so we always knew we’d get married in someone’s backyard,” explains Naomi.", "“That was a big, big yes, because they’ve been so wonderful to us and so supportive of Markarian, and obviously, we said that we would be honored to work with them again on something so big.”  When Biden and Moon visited O’Neill’s studio for fittings, they were very clear about their vision. “[Naomi] wanted something that was fun [and] that was going to be easy to change into after wearing all of her more formal looks for the ceremony and rehearsal dinner. She wanted something that had a lot of movement, that was going to be easy to dance in,” O’Neill says. “We talked about some sparkly looks and some short dresses and something with a little more detail to it, and ultimately settled on a little hand-beaded fringe minidress. We added some really beautiful bows and satin with little trains coming off. It was really kind of the perfect combination of something that was fun, but also special and classic.” Ten of O’Neill’s team members also worked on the dress, which featured hand-done beadwork that was hand-sewn onto the bodice. “We worked really closely together on this,” she added.   The project was a joy for O’Neill, 36, and an opportunity to work with another young talent whose business was lifted in its early days by the Bidens.", "Naomi was so taken with the young law student—who had interned at the Obama White House and worked for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign—that she texted him the next day while he was on an Amtrak train, headed back to his summer internship in DC, to suggest he disembark in Wilmington and come visit her at her grandparents’ instead. “He did it,” says Naomi with a hint of triumph. (Peter’s taxi driver was impressed when he gave him the address: “That’s Joe Biden’s house!”)  Three years later, Peter proposed in his hometown of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, with an emerald-cut diamond fitted on his grandmother’s gold band, even as Naomi’s family assembled as a surprise at his family home.  At the White House, as a magnificent sunset outlines the Washington Monument in shades of lavender and pink, Naomi’s two little sisters, Finnegan, 22, and Maisy, 21, shuffle into the Blue Room where everyone is oohing over the cloudscape. They have their hands over their eyes and so move a little clumsily in their sweatsuits. “We don’t want to see the dress before!” the sisters chime. “Is Nana here yet?” DAY TO REMEMBER Bride and groom beside their eight-tiered cake—with Naomi in Reem Acra—and on the White House balcony on their wedding day, Saturday, November 19, 2022.", "Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged inPlease refresh your browser to be logged in The president’s eldest granddaughter took wedding inspiration from Grace Kelly, Princess of Monaco  Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Joe Biden’s granddaughter votes for first time alongside president Noami Biden, the eldest granddaughter of President Joe Biden, wore three dresses while celebrating her White House wedding to Peter Neal.

The celebration also marked the first White House wedding with a president’s granddaughter as the bride, and the first one on the South Lawn, according to the White House Historical Association. In a recent Vogue cover story documenting Naomi’s big day, it was revealed the bride made a number of wardrobe changes throughout the evening. Naomi, the daughter of Hunter Biden and Kathleen Buhle, walked down the aisle wearing a high-neck, long-sleeved Chantilly lace dress designed by Ralph Lauren. The dress was paired with a cathedral-length silk organza veil, featuring a matching Chantilly lace border. She completed the look with a pair of diamond-encrusted Tiffany & Co platinum earrings, according to CNN. The drop earrings reportedly contain South Sea pearls, which are listed for $9,300 per pair on the Tiffany website.", "President Biden's granddaughter looked stunning in a long-sleeve gown. Ahead of Naomi Biden's wedding to Peter Neal, speculation over what designer President Biden's granddaughter would pick to design her wedding dress was high.  Would it be Ralph Lauren, the quintessential American designer, who invited Naomi to their Fall/Winter 2022 fashion show? Would it be Valentino, who dressed Naomi for President Biden's inauguration night last year? Or perhaps Reem Acra, a favorite of her grandmother, First Lady Jill Biden, or maybe her former employer Tom Ford (she interned for the brand in college)? Now we know: Naomi Biden wore Ralph Lauren at her South Lawn wedding ceremony. She looked elegant in a long-sleeved gown, with a long veil and train. She kept her accessories simple, wearing a pair of Tiffany diamond and pearl drop earrings, and carried a bouquet of white flowers. Her wedding band was Tiffany as well—as was Neal's band. He paired it with a Schlumberger single daisy brooch. First Lady Jill Biden's outfit kept to her classic style: she wore a teal wool crepe coat and a blue silk chiffon dress designed by Reem Acra.

Sports scientists and mathematicians have spent years studying the best and fairest ways to organise tournaments. With five billion people expected to tune in to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, the pressure to get it right is on. The most frequent criticism of FIFA’s draws for World Cup groups is that they tend to produce groups of unequal strength. Some may get a comparatively easy ride through the group stage while others could find themselves in a “group of death”. Organisers need to make sure strong teams aren’t penalised for their strength, while avoiding the emergence of any weak groups, to maintain fairness and keep TV audiences riveted.  FIFA’s seeding system assigns the host nation and the seven strongest teams to each of the eight groups. To guarantee a geographical spread, it defines six qualifying zones: Africa, Asia, Europe, North and Central America, with the Caribbean, Oceania and South America in the final pot. No two teams from the same zone – except Europe – can be in the same group, while no more than two European teams can be in the same group. At first glance, this year’s draw seems pretty even-handed.

The touchdown put Los Angeles back on top over the Cincinnati Bengals. The Los Angeles Rams won't have to travel far to enjoy a celebratory Super Bowl victory parade. The Rams rallied for a late touchdown to defeat the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday, 23-20, marking the second straight year a team won the Super Bowl on its home field. The championship capped a triumphant return to Los Angeles for the Rams, which won its only other Super Bowl as the St. Louis Rams in 2000. And the team's home field at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif., also hosted a halftime show that featured hip-hop with a West Coast flair. The Rams needed more than 59 minutes to seal the victory in Super Bowl LVI, with Cooper Kupp, the game's most valuable player, catching a short touchdown pass from quarterback Matthew Stafford with 1.25 left to play. That put the Rams on top — again — and for the final time. L.A. started off the game strong.

Microsoft is introducing a new consumer tier to its Microsoft 365 subscription offerings. Priced at just $1.99 per month, Microsoft 365 Basic is designed to replace the 100GB OneDrive storage option with some extra features that sit in between the free option and the $6.99 a month Personal subscription. Microsoft 365 Basic will be available worldwide on January 30th with 100GB of cloud storage, an ad-free Outlook web and mobile experience, and enhanced security features. The security features include data encryption for an Outlook mailbox, suspicious link checking, and virus / malware scanning for attachments. Existing OneDrive 100GB storage customers will be automatically upgraded to Microsoft 365 Basic at the same $1.99 monthly rate. “Later this year, we’ll have a bunch of stuff with OneDrive advanced security that will be available as well, that includes Personal Vault, password-protected and expiring links, ransomware detection and recovery, and bulk file restore,” says Gareth Oystryk, director of product marketing for Microsoft 365, in an interview with The Verge.

Basic subscribers will have to use the web or mobile versions instead. “We know many people are using our services today, but some of them run out of storage or want additional benefits that you don’t get with the free Microsoft 365 experience,” says Oystryk. “We also designed this specifically with Windows users in mind.” The Microsoft 365 Basic package is aimed at Windows users that need extra storage but also feels like Microsoft’s way of familiarizing people with its productivity subscriptions. “Is the Office brand going away entirely? No.” Microsoft is also renaming its Office app on mobile and Windows to Microsoft 365 later this month. It reflects the branding changes Microsoft announced last year, where Microsoft Office will largely be referred to as Microsoft 365 going forward. “Is the Office brand going away entirely?

Although the name might be unfamiliar, you’ve probably seen the output from Midjourney’s system floating about your social media feeds already. To generate your own, you just join Midjourney’s Discord, type a prompt, and the system makes an image for you.  Midjourney exists on Discord because “people want to make things together” “A lot of people ask us, why don’t you just make an iOS app that makes you a picture?” Midjourney’s founder, David Holz, told The Verge in an interview. “But people want to make things together, and if you do that on iOS, you have to make your own social network. And that’s pretty hard. So if you want your own social experience, Discord is really great.” Sign up for a free account, and you get 25 credits, with all images generated in public chatrooms. After that, you’ll have to pay — either $10 or $30 a month, depending on the number of images you want to make and whether or not they’re private to you.

We're just sort of here to work on things we're passionate about and have fun.

In order to really figure out what this is and what it should be, we really need to do a lot of experiments.\" The unsettled nature of AI image technology is evident in the difference between tools like Midjourney and a downloadable open source graphics application like Blender, or a locally installed commercial application like Adobe Photoshop (before it became a cloud service). Midjourney exists in a social context. Its front-end is the chat service Discord.

The researchers developed new encoders for Imagen Editor and also included an object detector module in the AI to compensate for incomplete or inaccurate masks. The research also includes a tool called EditBench to evaluate results of text-guided inpainting. Based on a 240-image dataset, the benchmark evaluated edits on both human-made and AI-generated images on parameters like the modified objects, their attributes like shape, size, number, and suitability for the scene. Google observed that object masking helps improve image-text alignment, making Imagen Editor better than alternatives like DALL-E 2 and StableDiffusion in all the categories EditBench tested. Unfortunately, Google has unspecified concerns related to the responsible use of AI, and that’s why it won’t be releasing Imagen Editor to the public. The company recently proposed a framework to safeguard AI development, and hopefully, a few hard limits can be established before giving people access to tools like Imagen Editor.

Though we only got a sneak peek, the results are impressive and prove that an era of advanced image manipulation for the masses isn’t far off, thanks to AI. Of course, AI-powered image editing is nothing new for Google. Handy tools like the Magic Eraser, for removing unwanted distractions, and Photo Unblur, for enhancing soft/blurred shots, have been around for several years. And Google has been leveraging AI to help organize and surface images in users’ libraries since 2015. But the Magic Editor takes AI-enhanced manipulation a leap further. Not only can users select and edit subjects (similar to using a mask in Lightroom/Capture One) but with a few taps of the screen you can easily scale and reposition subjects in the frame. The demo also shows the tool's ability to expand an image’s composition through generative AI. Of course, the results aren’t perfect. In the example with the balloons, for instance, the portion of the bench created using generative AI shows a noticeable red tint. Similarly, in the waterfall demo, the area under the subject’s arm shows an obvious repeating pattern in the rocks. These criticisms aside, the power of this tool to dramatically reshape image editing on the fly can’t be understated.", "If you ask Word to create a document based on your data, Copilot will send that prompt to the Microsoft Graph to retrieve the context and data before modifying the prompt and sending it to the GPT-4 large language model.

Click chemistry revolutionized the options available to chemists for creating the molecules they desired. Bioorthogonal chemistry made it possible to monitor the chemical processes going on inside living cells without harming them. “It’s all about snapping molecules together,” said Johan Åqvist, chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, during the announcement. Imagine, he told the audience, that you could attach small chemical buckles to a bunch of different types of molecular building blocks and then link these buckles together to produce complex molecules.

It's an even broader group of digital cards than the updated version of Google Pay, which is why users in the US and Singapore will have support for both services.

To refer to certain sets of technology stocks that lead the stock market, analysts and investors often use terms like FANG, FAANG, MAANG, MATANA, and more. Investing in these stock groups can have multiple benefits, such as diversification, compensating for any losses that one of the companies may experience, as well as exposure to growing sectors. Many of these companies focus on rapidly growing sectors, such as artificial intelligence (IA), which has become the technological trend of 2023 following the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Furthermore, by hosting the most popular technology companies, these groups have great liquidity, making it very easy to buy or sell their stocks, and providing greater flexibility for investors to invest in other companies. And obviously, the companies included in these groups have historical success in markets. For example, FANG is composed of four renowned technology companies: Facebook Inc – its name was changed to META Platforms Inc (NYSE: META), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Google LLC (NASDAQ: GOOGL).", "How many more subscriptions are you going to handle?\" he said. \"Product placement should be where they are, plus the ability to do IP licensing.

It is a fast-moving place where we can no longer ignore acronyms. There is no need to LOL, IMHO. We just have to keep up ASAP.  Keeping with the theme of tech, one big event that drew the attention of many eyes this past week was Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Sept. 7 unveiling of its newest products. The introduction of the latest array of iPhones, Apple Watches and Air Pods always has some sort of impact on the company’s stock. Apple stock was bolstered about 0.9% on the news of the event, and ended the day last Wednesday up 0.5%. It closed the week on Friday at $157.37, up 1.88% on the day and down 0.43% in the last 12 months."], "noise_rate": 0.2, "factlabel": 0}

The stores sell various Apple products, including Mac personal computers, iPhone smartphones, iPad tablet computers, Apple Watch smartwatches, Apple TV digital media players, software, and both Apple-branded and selected third-party accessories.  The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs, after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts. Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship with consumers and hired Ron Johnson in 2000. Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997 and opened the first two physical stores in 2001. The media initially speculated that Apple would fail, but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so. Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage over the years, with 526 stores across 26 countries and regions worldwide, opening its latest store in the Battersea district of London, United Kingdom on June 15, 2023.[2][3] Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16 billion globally in 2011.", "A few days after that, he is set to unlock the doors on the New Delhi store, in a high-end mall in the Saket neighborhood. That store’s barricades lifted on Tuesday. The two stores have been a long time in the making as India’s strict rules forbid global brands from opening own-brand outlets unless they source a significant portion of the goods from within the country. Apple didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment on Cook’s visit. The company opened its Indian online store in 2020. The country is the world’s second-largest smartphone market and among the fastest-growing, but Apple’s relatively high sticker prices are still a deterrent in the nation of 1.4 billion where affordability plays a major role in purchase decisions. In between the two store inaugurals, Apple has sought a meeting for Cook with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said one of the people. Modi’s government has been pushing for electronics manufacturing and has offered billions of dollars in incentives to attract Apple’s manufacturing partners like Foxconn Technology Group and Pegatron Corp. On Apple earnings calls, Cook has stressed India’s importance as a market and production base. During the latest such conference, Cook said Apple set “a quarterly revenue record and grew very strong double digits year over year” in the country. “India is a hugely exciting market for us and a major focus,” Cook said on the call. “I’m very bullish on India.” --With assistance from Mark Gurman.", "Apr 19, 2023 ... Cook will travel to New Delhi to open a second store, Apple Saket, at the center of the capital's biggest mall. The Apple brand is not new to ...", "\"Apple as usual has got the timing right on 'peaking at the right time' with its flagship store strategy to catalyse this trend in its favour,\" Shah told CNBC via email. India has a growing middle class, a young and \"mobile first\" population willing to pay more for phones, especially in Mumbai and Delhi, two of the country's wealthiest cities and the location of the new Apple stores. Apple's India push offers the opportunity for the U.S. technology giant to boost revenue and iPhone sales near the levels seen in markets like the U.S. and China, analysts said. Apple shipped about 6.5 million iPhones in India in 2022, compared to around 50 million each year in both the U.S. and China, according to Counterpoint Research. Shah said India \"has the potential to reach that scale\" in the coming years. Shipments refer to the iPhones Apple sends to retailers but do not equal sales. However, it is an indicator of the demand for iPhones in a country. Apple made $6 billion in revenue in the year through to March, growing 50%, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing a person familiar with the matter. Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said that could rise further over the next two years.", "Apple is aiming to boost sales and manufacturing of iPhones in India in a move analysts say resembles its strategy when it first entered China, now one of the company's biggest markets. Apple claims its Mumbai store is \"one of the most energy-efficient\" locations in the world and has a dedicated solar energy system and has zero reliance on fossil fuels for the store's operations. Apple BKC runs on 100% renewable energy, Apple said. Cook has long viewed India as a key market to Apple's future and in February he said he was \"bullish\" on the world's fifth-largest economy and the company is putting a \"significant amount of energy\" into the market. Cook traveled to India for the opening of the store, nearly seven years after his first visit as Apple CEO. India's smartphone market, however, has been dominated in recent years by Samsung and Chinese brands such as Xiaomi, with low-to-mid-tier priced devices finding support from customers in a price-sensitive market. Apple has very little market share in India. But India is undergoing a \"premiumification of market,\" according to Neil Shah, partner at Counterpoint Research. Smartphones priced above $400 now account for 10% of the total volumes of handsets shipped versus 4% before the pandemic, according to Shah. He said this category of smartphones accounts for 35% of total smartphone market revenue."], "noise_rate": 0.2, "factlabel": 0}
