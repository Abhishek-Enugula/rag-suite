The Nobel Prize in physics for 2022 is being awarded to Alain Aspect, John F. Clauser and Anton Zeilinger for their work on quantum mechanics, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced on October 4, 2022.  The 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded “for experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities, and pioneering quantum information science,” the academy said. The 2022 physics laureates’ development of experimental tools has laid the foundation for a new era of quantum technology. Being able to manipulate and manage quantum states and all their layers of properties gives us access to tools with unexpected potential.  Intense research and development are underway to utilise the special properties of individual particle systems to construct quantum computers, improve measurements, build quantum networks and establish secure quantum encrypted communication. This year’s Nobel Prize laureate John Clauser built an apparatus that emitted two entangled photons at a time, each towards a filter that tested their polarisation. The result was a clear violation of a Bell inequality and agreed with the predictions of quantum mechanics.", "A 1986 DNA model used by Aziz Sancar, who was awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.   © Nobel Media.

By Cora Engelbrecht, Euan Ward and Oliver Whang The 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry has been awarded to three scientists whose work harnessed the power of molecular interaction and introduced new, unobtrusive ways of studying the natural world. Carolyn R. Bertozzi of Stanford University, Morten Meldal of the University of Copenhagen and K. Barry Sharpless of Scripps Research will share the prize, which honors the scientists’ independent research that resulted in the development of what is known as click chemistry and bio-orthogonal chemistry. The three researchers will also split a prize of 10 million Swedish kronor, around $900,000. Their works have “led to a revolution in how chemists think about linking molecules together,” said Johan Aqvist, the chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry.

Martin. Miyazaki has said that Elden Ring will be “full of things that we weren’t able to do in the Dark Souls series.” The game will focus “more heavily on RPG elements,” Miyazaki said in an interview from 2019, and “will include a wide variety of weapons, magic, and ways to engage enemies, that make it possible to provide users with a style of gameplay and strategy that suits them.” FromSoftware fans have since been wracked with Elden Ring-information withdrawal, leading the community to fill the void with its own, self-created lore.

The six main areas are traversed using the player character's steed Torrent as the primary mode of travel. Linear, hidden dungeons can be explored to find useful items. Players can use several types of weapons and magic spells, including non-direct engagement enabled by stealth mechanics. Throughout the game's world, checkpoints enable fast travel and allow players to improve their attributes using an in-game currency called Runes. Elden Ring has an online multiplayer mode in which players can join each other for cooperative and player-versus-player combat.  During planning, FromSoftware wanted to create an open-world game with gameplay similar to Dark Souls; the company wanted Elden Ring to act as an evolution of the self-titled debut of the series.

Arguably the most anticipated Grand Slam on the tennis calendar, the Melbourne tournament has everything and this year won't be different. Ranging from interactive activities to some of the biggest names in the world, the Australian Open doesn't disappoint. Looking back, the 2022 event was nothing short of outstanding. Australian Ash Barty broke a 44-year-old record to claim her first Grand Slam on her home turf. While Rafael Nadal - who notched his 21st Grand Slam - remarkably came back from two sets to love to defeat 2021 US Open (tournament before Aus Open) champion Daniil Medvedev. Here's how it played out. Barty came into the tournament ranked no.1 in the world and knew what it took to win a Grand Slam. Having previously won at Wimbledon (2021) and the French Open (2019), the Queenslander wanted to take home the prize that meant the most: a trophy on her home soil. Despite the pressure of expectation to take out the 2022 championship, Barty's form never wavered throughout the two weeks, resulting in no sets lost. In the final, the Australian came up against American, Danielle Collins, who she had the reign over in previous battles.", "She has won so many 6-0 sets this year — a “bagel” in tennis parlance — that the saying “Iga’s bakery” was coined.

In March, Ashleigh Barty of Australia, a three-time Grand Slam singles champion and the world No. 1, abruptly retired at 25 years old, saying she had accomplished all she wanted in the sport and was ready for a new challenge. In her departure, Barty, then the reigning Wimbledon and Australian Open champion, left a significant void in women’s tennis, which has largely been a free-for-all in recent years. No woman has won more than two Grand Slam titles in a calendar year since Williams won three in 2015. Since late 2020, Swiatek has done all she can to bring some order to women’s tennis, winning three of the past 10 Grand Slam titles. Beyond her dominance on the court, Swiatek has assumed a leadership role off it. She has spoken out against the Russian invasion of Ukraine more than any player who is not from Ukraine and has helped raise more than $2 million for relief efforts through her participation in tennis exhibitions, one of which she organized herself. “We’re trying to do our best to be good people,” she said during the trophy ceremony, as red-and-white Polish flags swung throughout the stands.", "For the first time since 1997, neither Venus nor Serena Williams participated in the Australian Open.[7]  This was the last singles major for former world No. 4 and 2011 US Open champion Samantha Stosur, who announced her retirement from the discipline.[8] She lost to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the second round.

It’s not apples to apples like other years.” Under the normal points system, Djokovic might not even qualify for the ATP Finals in Turin, Italy, this year. Heading into Paris, he was in 10th place in the points race. But under the ATP’s Grand Slam champion rule, any player who wins a major title and is ranked within the top 20 is guaranteed a spot in the year-end championship. (The WTA Tour has no such rule, which is why Djokovic’s fellow Wimbledon champion, Elena Rybakina, did not qualify for the WTA Finals in Fort Worth.) “Most of the upheaval this year is because of Djokovic,” Patrick McEnroe, a former United States Davis Cup captain and now an ESPN commentator said. “He missed two majors and didn’t get points for the one he won. It really affected the rest of the field. You could make the case that if Djokovic runs the table, wins Paris and the ATP Finals, that he deserves to be No. 1.” The player most likely to end 2022 at No. 1 is Alcaraz.

Entertainment & Arts  Every year people complain about the awards show surplus. We finally got rid of the most absurd and corrupt of them — and now the Globes are back? Why?

Now that the organization has outlined its plans for reform, publicists and agents say that some stars are open to participating, while others want the Globes to be permanently retired. Based on this year’s list of presenters — which include Billy Porter, Natasha Lyonne and Quentin Tarantino — many are planning to show up on Tuesday. Wait, aren’t awards shows usually on Sunday?

We have a great team in place to grow this iconic brand and captivate new and existing audiences to celebrate the very best in television and motion pictures.” The ceremony is currently scheduled for January 7, though there is not yet a broadcast partner for the awards show. It could feasibly end up on a major network or a streaming platform, as was the case for the SAG Awards, which aired live on Netflix’s  YouTube page earlier this year. On February 21, 2021, a Los Angeles Times investigation accused the HFPA of “self-dealing” and highlighted potential conflicts of interest.

Looking back at previous releases, the RTX 4080 hit the scene in November, with the RTX 4070 Ti hot on its heels in early January 2023, and the standard RTX 4070 was the latest to join the party. Even the 4060 Ti also debuted just over a month ago.", "Subscribe to our newsletter for the latest updates on Esports, Gaming and more. Configuration: Intel i9-12900k, 1440p, Ultra Settings In leaked benchmarks, this behemoth of a GPU managed to perform 82% better than the RTX 3090 in Time Spy Extreme, according to Kopite7Kimi. This is extremely promising for Nvidia’s upcoming GPU, and we believe that it will absolutely trample all over current consumer graphics cards available today.  In gaming workloads, leaked benchmarks suggest that the 4090 performs exceptionally. Leaker XpeaGPU revealed that the card managed to run Control at 4K, with Ray Tracing and DLSS on at a blisteringly fast 160FPS. This is no small feat for a game that is notorious for bringing many GPUs to their knees with how heavy it can run. Though, remember that these are leaked benchmarks, are by no means official, and can change compared to the final product. The RTX 4090 is available at all good electronics retailers. Though, we’ve seen many of them already go live, and have listed where you can buy these upcoming GPUs earlier in this article.  It’s likely that we will see more AIB cards hit the market after the initial launch, from the likes of companies like PALIT and more. However, these are likely to come some weeks after launch, possibly due to logistical reasons.", "Though, this may indicate that many consumers might not be lapping up Nvidia’s Ada Lovelace graphics cards as quickly as they were before. However, features such as DLSS 3 may go a long way to convince users to go with Nvidia’s lineup when compared to AMD.  The RTX 4080 16GB is priced at $1199. We previously speculated that the now-canceled RTX 4080 12GB would even make it to market as an RTX 4070, but Nvidia was paralyzed over what to actually define it as earlier this year, it appears that the same has happened once again. Now, it appears that it’ll come back as an RTX 4070 Ti.  It’s a tricky one, though for those looking for value. We’re currently witnessing existing GPUs drop in price after cryptocurrency bottomed out spectacularly and hasn’t recovered. After Ethereum moved on from mining via GPUs, there’s been a flood on the secondary market for 30-series models, which could call into question the value of the new GPUs.  The RTX 4080 is incredibly quick, especially in Overwatch 2. At 1440p, Ultra settings, the RTX 4080 16GB manages to push around 470 FPS.

The results amount to the best midterm performance for a sitting party in 20 years. US President Joe Biden said he was incredibly pleased, and it was time for Republicans to decide \"who they are\". Democratic Senate Majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said the results showed the American people had rejected what he called the \"violent rhetoric\" of the Republican Party.

Just ask 42-year-old Ryan Gosling, who, after landing the role of Ken in the new Barbie movie, has faced claims he is too “ancient” to play the doll. The internet is already obsessed with the first live-action Barbie movie, thanks to trailers released ahead of the Warner Bros. film’s debut next month. (The Washington Post has previously described the trailers as “fever-dream-like.”) But the promotional material has already prompted some critics to use the hashtag #NotMyKen to express their disappointment in Gosling’s casting, writing on social media that he is too old to play the part of the chiseled doll with perfect hair. “I can’t be the only one that thinks Ryan gosling looks old to play Ken,” read one of many tweets questioning the star’s age. “Ryan Gosling looks old and washed out in this to me. I think it’d have made more sense with someone younger at this point,” read another, while a third said: “that’s so sad that man is ancient.” Gosling responded to the criticism Wednesday in an interview with GQ magazine, saying: “If people don’t want to play with my Ken, there are many other Kens to play with.” He also joked that for decades nobody has ever particularly cared about Ken, who is really known only as Barbie’s boyfriend and the guy who works at the beach. “It is funny ...", "\"I was also going to do a specialty cameo with Timmy, and both of them couldn't do it and I was so annoyed.

Margot Robbie told British Vogue that she's aware that the Barbie character \"comes with a lot of baggage. And a lot of nostalgic connections.

We plan to give select Pixel phones early access later this year.          Since its launch in 2015, Google Photos has used AI to help you get the most out of your memories — from automatically organizing and resurfacing your photos to helping you edit them with advanced tools like Magic Eraser and Photo Unblur. Today at I/O, we gave a sneak peek of Magic Editor, a new experimental editing experience that uses generative AI to help you reimagine your photos and make editing even easier. With Magic Editor, you’ll be able to make complex edits without pro-level editing skills. Using a combination of AI techniques, including generative AI, it will help you make edits to specific parts of an image — like the subject, sky or background — so you have even more control over the final look and feel of your photo. Sometimes the difference between a so-so picture and the perfect shot comes down to getting the framing just right. Magic Editor will help you improve the overall composition of your photo by allowing you to reposition the subject of your shot to the best spot. For example, if you’re trying to get the perfect photo from your time at a popular waterfall, you could remove the bag strap you forgot to take off. You could also make the sky brighter and less cloudy, so it matches how you remember that day.", "Masked region and Imagen Editor’s results for “a bouquet of red flowers,” “two trees,” “an Imagen Editor sign,” “a bush with green leaves,” and “a bush without leaves” Technically called inpainting, the process Google’s new tool uses is like an image restoration or something we can best describe as the confluence of Google AI and Adobe Photoshop’s Content Aware Fill. The researchers developed new encoders for Imagen Editor and also included an object detector module in the AI to compensate for incomplete or inaccurate masks. The research also includes a tool called EditBench to evaluate results of text-guided inpainting. Based on a 240-image dataset, the benchmark evaluated edits on both human-made and AI-generated images on parameters like the modified objects, their attributes like shape, size, number, and suitability for the scene. Google observed that object masking helps improve image-text alignment, making Imagen Editor better than alternatives like DALL-E 2 and StableDiffusion in all the categories EditBench tested. Unfortunately, Google has unspecified concerns related to the responsible use of AI, and that’s why it won’t be releasing Imagen Editor to the public. The company recently proposed a framework to safeguard AI development, and hopefully, a few hard limits can be established before giving people access to tools like Imagen Editor. On the bright side, EditBench is available in its entirety, for free, to help further AI research.", "While Microsoft is certainly moving quickly with its AI-powered vision for Office apps, there will certainly be concerns around this speed of innovation and the accuracy of its AI models, particularly when Microsoft 365 users may well be using them with business data in the months ahead.  “We make it clear how the system makes decisions by noting limitations, linking to sources, and prompting users to review, fact-check and adjust content based on subject-matter expertise,” says Spataro in a blog post today, noting the company’s AI principles. Microsoft recently laid off its ethics and society team within the artificial intelligence organization. The team had been working to identify risks posed by Microsoft’s adoption of OpenAI’s language models throughout its software and services. That’s left some inside and outside Microsoft concerned at the pace of AI-powered software, but Spataro doesn’t share the same concerns. “To serve the unmet needs of our customers, we must move quickly and responsibly, learning as we go,” says Spataro. “ We’re testing Copilot with a small group of customers to get feedback and improve our models as we scale, and we will expand to more soon.” Microsoft is clearly starting small to ensure any costly mistakes are discovered early on. “When the system gets things wrong, or has biases, or is misused, we have mitigations in place,” says Jamie Teevan, Microsoft’s chief scientist. “We’re tackling the long term implications and novel risks like jailbreaks.", "There have long been discussions about how far a photo can be edited before it’s no longer a photo, and Google’s tools push us closer to a world where we tap on every image to perfect it, reality or not. Samsung recently brought attention to the power of AI-“enhanced” photos with “Space Zoom,” a feature that’s supposed to let you capture incredible pictures of the Moon on newer Galaxy devices. In March, a Reddit user tried using Space Zoom on an almost unsalvageable image of the Moon and found that Samsung appeared to add craters and other patches that weren’t actually there. Not only does this run the risk of creating a “fake” image of the Moon, but it also leaves actual space photographers in a strange place, as they spend years mastering the art of capturing the night sky, only for the public to often be presented with fakes. To be fair, there are a ton of similar photography-enhancing features that are built in to smartphone cameras. As my colleague Allison Johnson points out, mobile photography already fakes a lot of things, whether it’s by applying filters or unblurring a photo, and doctored images are nothing new.

This is a well-deserved Nobel Prize. I couldn’t be happier for her.” Cohen said that Bertozzi is also “a great mentor to all of the scientists around her, and has always been an inspirational role model for both women and LGBTQ people in science.” Bertozzi and others have used her methods to answer fundamental questions about the role of sugars in biology, to study how cells build proteins and other molecules, to develop new cancer medicines, and to produce new materials for energy storage, among many other applications.", "The Nobel Prize in Chemistry (Swedish: Nobelpriset i kemi) is awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to scientists in the various fields of chemistry.

Eight teams from each conference participated in the playoffs. The top six teams in each conference, based on winning percentage, directly qualified for the playoffs; the seeding order of those teams was also based on winning percentage. If two or more teams had the same record, standard NBA tiebreaker rules were used.  The NBA Board of Governors approved a format for the 2021–22 season to have a play-in tournament involving the teams ranked 7th through 10th in each conference. The 7th place team and 8th place team participated in a \"double-chance\" game, with the winner advancing to the playoffs as the 7-seed. The loser then played the winner of the elimination game between the 9th place and 10th place teams to determine the playoff's 8-seed.

The Bulls struggled on offense, shooting a season-low 32.3% from the floor, with DeMar DeRozan and Zach LaVine shooting a combined 12-of-44 (27.3%).   While the Bulls were leading by as much as 18 in the third quarter, they withstood two furious rallies in both the third and fourth quarters by the Bucks, with DeMar DeRozan scoring a playoff career-high 41 points. This was the Bulls' first playoff victory since Game 2 of the 2017 Eastern Conference First Round against the Boston Celtics. Two Bucks players suffered injuries during the game: Bobby Portis left mid-game after suffering a \"right eye abrasion\" and Khris Middleton suffered a sprained MCL in his left knee.

The Louisiana-based satellite company, it was announced, has entered into a partnership with Apple to provide users of the iPhone 14 Pro with emergency services via direct-to-satellite communications. The iPhone 14 Pro is equipped with an antenna that will give users the ability to connect to satellite frequencies to use a text-based service to communicate their location in case of emergency in areas without cell service. The announcement resulted in Globalstar stock soaring last Wednesday, hitting a high on the day of $2.28. It, however, quickly retraced from that high, hitting a low the following day of $1.66. It closed the week on Friday at $1.77. Globalstar Weekly Chart Source: Investing.com The initial roller coaster effect was based purely on a knee-jerk reaction to the announcement by Apple. The stock's failure to launch in any sustainable upward movement, however, is more a reflection of reality.

You have successfully joined our subscriber list. iIn this guide, we will focus on the MATANA group that is expected to make headlines in the coming years, according to analysts. To refer to certain sets of technology stocks that lead the stock market, analysts and investors often use terms like FANG, FAANG, MAANG, MATANA, and more. Investing in these stock groups can have multiple benefits, such as diversification, compensating for any losses that one of the companies may experience, as well as exposure to growing sectors. Many of these companies focus on rapidly growing sectors, such as artificial intelligence (IA), which has become the technological trend of 2023 following the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Furthermore, by hosting the most popular technology companies, these groups have great liquidity, making it very easy to buy or sell their stocks, and providing greater flexibility for investors to invest in other companies. And obviously, the companies included in these groups have historical success in markets. For example, FANG is composed of four renowned technology companies: Facebook Inc – its name was changed to META Platforms Inc (NYSE: META), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Google LLC (NASDAQ: GOOGL).", "As it continues to regroup from a post-pandemic hangover, Amazon gave a cautious outlook for the first quarter of 2023. The extent to which retail spending and digital transformation are on hold won’t be known until Amazon reports Q1 results in late-April. The Street thinks better news and big gains lie ahead.  Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has a projected gain that’s right behind that of Amazon. The consensus price target is just shy of $130, which means 37% separates Alphabet from its current bogey. It’s upside that seems reasonable considering the online search king is down roughly the same percentage from its February 2022 peak.  Wall Street's unanimously bullish position makes Alphabet a more compelling MATANA pick. Over the past three months, a perfect 32 of 32 firms have called Alphabet stock a ‘buy.’ It's hard to take a contrarian stance when more than two dozen analysts who eat, sleep and breathe the company see Alphabet stock heading higher.  The reset button has effectively been hit for Alphabet after reporting just 2% revenue growth for the fourth quarter. Yes, advertisers have pulled back spending in a weakened economy, but it doesn’t change Google’s command of the search market.

The Street’s $292 target implies 13% upside, slightly ahead of Apple’s projected gain. Microsoft’s run from here may be limited because the stock has already bounced 20% off its November 2022 low. Microsoft's rally has come at the hands of two major catalysts. First, better-than-expected December quarter earnings suggested an inflection point is near regarding sluggish Windows, Office and Azure spending. For the current quarter, analysts anticipate 11% bottom-line growth, which would be the highest in five quarters.  Second, the company’s aggressive push into conversational AI has demonstrated leadership in this emerging technology. Microsoft recently announced that its Edge and Bing browsers would come with AI chat functionality similar to ChatGPT in which it has invested $10 billion.  Based on the sharp year-to-date advance (and technical indicators such as MACD), Microsoft could probably have a better entry point.

The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs, after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts. Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship with consumers and hired Ron Johnson in 2000. Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997 and opened the first two physical stores in 2001. The media initially speculated that Apple would fail, but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so.

But if you look at it over a long arc of time, I think there's a good opportunity across the board,” he said. Mr. Cook also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his recent visit.
