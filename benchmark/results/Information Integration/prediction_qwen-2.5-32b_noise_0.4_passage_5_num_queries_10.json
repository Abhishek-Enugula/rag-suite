After last year's contest in Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, the Super Bowl heads out west to SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, for Super Bowl 56. From then on, the Super Bowl will continue to be held in dome stadiums for a while. Each of the next three announced venues will have a roof over the heads of the fans and players, and will be in warmer weather areas, as is typical of the Super Bowl. Sporting News has you covered with all you need to know about the location of this year's Super Bowl, as well as the host site in future years. This year's Super Bowl will be held at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, California. The home of the Rams and the Chargers, SoFi Stadium was originally set to host the Super Bowl in 2021, however its opening was delayed until 2020, and NFL rules dictate that a stadium has to be open for at least two seasons before it can host the title game. This will be the third time the city has hosted the Super Bowl, with the L.A. Memorial Coliseum having hosted it twice (1967, 1973). Pasadena also hosted the Super Bowl five times (1977, 1980, 1983, 1987, 1993) in the Rose Bowl.", "Play Now                                                           Football Pick'em                                                               Play Now                                                           College Pick'em   See who to add and drop   PGA Tour and beyond  After a six-year hiatus, the Super Bowl will return to the Golden State in February of 2022.

The home of the Rams and Chargers, SoFi Stadium is located in Inglewood, about a 20-minute drive from Los Angeles. Super Bowl LVI is slated to be kicked off on Sunday, February 6.  Next year will mark the 13th Super Bowl played in California. Santa Clara, San Diego, Pasadena, Palo Alto, and Los Angles are the California cities that have previously hosted a Super Bowl.

Bertozzi, Morten Meldal and K. Barry Sharpless were honored for their advances in “click chemistry,” which has played a role in treating and diagnosing illnesses. By Cora Engelbrecht, Euan Ward and Oliver Whang The 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry has been awarded to three scientists whose work harnessed the power of molecular interaction and introduced new, unobtrusive ways of studying the natural world. Carolyn R. Bertozzi of Stanford University, Morten Meldal of the University of Copenhagen and K. Barry Sharpless of Scripps Research will share the prize, which honors the scientists’ independent research that resulted in the development of what is known as click chemistry and bio-orthogonal chemistry. The three researchers will also split a prize of 10 million Swedish kronor, around $900,000. Their works have “led to a revolution in how chemists think about linking molecules together,” said Johan Aqvist, the chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry. In winning the award on Wednesday, Dr. Sharpless became only the fifth person to win two Nobels, having received the chemistry prize in 2001 for his work on chirally catalyzed oxidation reactions.
