That was just a heck of a drive by Kentucky, highlighted by Wan'Dale Robinson's 52-yard catch-and-run to give him 17 catches for 170 yards so far today.

Their previous Super Bowl opponent has better odds, despite Tampa Bay returning all 22 starters from their Super Bowl squad. The Buccaneers are currently +600 to win it all in 2022, according to Vegas Insider. Behind the Buccaneers in the NFC are the Green Bay Packers (+1300), the San Francisco 49ers (+1400), and the Los Angeles Rams (+1400). Despite losing Super Bowl LV, the Chiefs head into 2022 as Super Bowl favorites. It’s not wild to assume they get back there, given they’ve been to the previous three conference championships and the last two Super Bowls. Their +500 odds to win the Super Bowl in 2022 are the best in the NFL. The Bills (+1000), Ravens (+1400), and Browns (+1600) are the other preseason contenders in the AFC.", "Super Bowl 56 is now the only game left in the 2022 NFL playoffs. The AFC and NFC champions have been crowned, and the Bengals will now face the Rams to determine the NFL champion for the 2021 NFL season. The 2022 NFL playoffs proved as unpredictable as the regular season. Wild-card weekend largely went as expected, but after that, chaos reigned. Both of the No. 1 seeds, the Packers and Titans, lost their first game in the divisional round, as all but one of the underdogs won outright. The lone exception was the favored Chiefs, who mounted a game-tying drive with 13 seconds left before winning in overtime. The conference championship games were wild in their own right. Both the Bengals and Rams trailed by double digits in the second half of their wins over the Chiefs and 49ers. They mounted comebacks and as a result, the Bengals will have a chance to win their first Super Bowl in franchise history in their first appearance since 1989. Meanwhile, the Rams will have a chance to avenge their loss against the Patriots in the big game just three years ago. As unpredictable as the playoffs have been, the Super Bowl broadcast, location and date are set in stone.

Because of the NFL's expanded, 17-game, 18-week schedule, it will be held on the second Sunday in February. This is the latest that a Super Bowl has ever been held. Super Bowls 44, 50 and 55 all were held on Feb. 7, which was previously the record for the latest Super Bowl. Under the NFL's new format, the latest date on which a Super Bowl can occur is Feb. 14.

By Cora Engelbrecht, Euan Ward and Oliver Whang The 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry has been awarded to three scientists whose work harnessed the power of molecular interaction and introduced new, unobtrusive ways of studying the natural world. Carolyn R. Bertozzi of Stanford University, Morten Meldal of the University of Copenhagen and K. Barry Sharpless of Scripps Research will share the prize, which honors the scientists’ independent research that resulted in the development of what is known as click chemistry and bio-orthogonal chemistry. The three researchers will also split a prize of 10 million Swedish kronor, around $900,000. Their works have “led to a revolution in how chemists think about linking molecules together,” said Johan Aqvist, the chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry. In winning the award on Wednesday, Dr. Sharpless became only the fifth person to win two Nobels, having received the chemistry prize in 2001 for his work on chirally catalyzed oxidation reactions. The other two-time winners were Marie Curie, John Bardeen, Linus Pauling and Frederick Sanger.

Miyazaki has said that Elden Ring will be “full of things that we weren’t able to do in the Dark Souls series.” The game will focus “more heavily on RPG elements,” Miyazaki said in an interview from 2019, and “will include a wide variety of weapons, magic, and ways to engage enemies, that make it possible to provide users with a style of gameplay and strategy that suits them.” FromSoftware fans have since been wracked with Elden Ring-information withdrawal, leading the community to fill the void with its own, self-created lore.

In the decades since, we’ve been developing our technology to deliver on that mission. The progress we've made is because of our years of investment in advanced technologies, from AI to the technical infrastructure that powers it all. And once a year — on my favorite day of the year :) — we share an update on how it’s going at Google I/O. Today, I talked about how we’re advancing two fundamental aspects of our mission — knowledge and computing — to create products that are built to help. It’s exciting to build these products; it’s even more exciting to see what people do with them. Thank you to everyone who helps us do this work, and most especially our Googlers.

Here's what you need to know. Google I/O is the biggest annual event for developers and consumers who are interested in the latest innovations from Google. The conference is where Google typically unveils new products and services and provides a sneak peek at what's coming. This year's show was held on 10 May 2023 as a hybrid event with a limited live audience and online access for everyone. Here's everything you need to know about Google I/O 2023. Google I/O is an annual developer conference hosted by Google, where the company showcases its latest technologies and products. The conference typically features keynote speeches, technical sessions, and product announcements, and attracts both developers and consumers. Google announced Google I/O 2023 through a blog post on the official Google Developers website in March. The post revealed the dates and format of the event and invited interested attendees to register for the event. The announcement was also shared on Google's social media channels. Like previous years, Google also teased the event with a binary field puzzle that fans had to solve to reveal the launch date. Googgle I/O 20213 took place on 10 May. The keynote occurred at 10am PT and lasted about two hours. Google I/O 2023 was broadcast online and is still available to everyone to watch.

Google usually doesn’t reveal much about what it plans to announce at the event. However, the company has now released the Google I/O 2022 schedule, giving us a brief overview of what to expect. Google I/O 2022 will be held on May 11 and May 12 at the Shoreline Amphitheater. The event will kick off with Sundar Pichai’s “Google I/O keynote” at 10 AM. This will be the main attraction for the general population as the main event tends to be more consumer-focused. While the event’s description doesn’t provide specifics, expect to see announcements for popular Google services, Workspace, privacy, health, and Google’s other new projects and endeavors. Also, keep an eye out for potential hardware announcements in the form of the Pixel 6a, Pixel Watch, and smart home devices. The main keynote will be followed by the Developer keynote and “What’s new in Android.” This is where we expect to learn more about Android 13, Wear OS, and updates to developer products and tools. Google says the schedule is slightly different this year.", "All keynotes and product announcements will take place on day one, while on-demand technical sessions will go live on day two. Here's the list of major keynotes and sessions that will take place on day 1: You can check out the full schedule for all sessions and keynotes at the Google I/O website.

Although Google I/O is meant primarily for developers, the opening keynote will unveil the company's latest consumer products and services, and perhaps even a sneak peek into products coming later this year. Google hasn't officially revealed what it plans to show at I/O, but we can make some smart guesses based on things Google revealed at I/O 2022 last year and credible rumors.

Field of Dreams stars Kevin Costner, Ray Liotta, James Earl Jones and Amy Madigan. It was nominated for the Academy Award® for Best Picture in 1990 and was selected to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 2017. The 1989 film, adapted from W. P. Kinsella's 1982 novel Shoeless Joe, tells the story of Iowa farmer Ray Kinsella, a husband and father who is tending to his cornfield when he hears a mysterious voice intone, \"If you build it, he will come.\" According to the American Film Institute (AFI), those words are the 39th top film quote of all-time.

From its opening, with careful admiration on the smooth blue fabric, there’s a richness invoked, one that remains for the film’s entirety. It’s a film about traditions, relationships, and the vibrant colors of the connections we create.At first glance, it seems like Mina (whose illness- though not specified, has her in a decline throughout the film) and Halim’s marriage is strained and distant.

When it’s just Susie having to confront the reality that her choices have sent her into a freefall necessitating an embracement of the unethical, things get stale no matter how endearing or effective the characterizations prove. And Anne becoming non-verbal seems a missed opportunity once Susie’s prime suspect is found innocent. Only she knows her daughter is never wrong. Thus we’re left in limbo. Susie operates out of pragmatism, not malice. We can’t “enjoy” her choices as much as wince in anticipation of her inevitable comeuppance because she’s not an anti-hero. We’re not supposed to give her the benefit of the doubt. By not having Anne as a logical point of conflict, however, there’s no one else to sustainably root for.

Admittedly, these jolts can make the movie feel episodic, leading me to wonder if they'd initially conceived of this as a web series or TV show. In the right headspace, this uneven ride can feel like binge-watching an addictive limited series. And, frankly, I value the rough edges when they come with such unexpected fun.  For the first act, Susie Searches runs the risk of feeling dated, presenting an amateur detective in the guileless light of literal kids stuff, like Harriet the Spy or Scooby Doo. At this point, we've been so glutted with crime shows that this tact feels tired. However, as Susie solves her mystery, the movie moves into motivations, urging the audience to reconsider their heroine, to re-examine the clues, and to question whether what we want is justice or just a good story.  Kargman and Day weave together a deceptively chipper tone with a cynical thread and an appetite for tension for a finale that is outrageous and rewarding.", "When fellow well-known and beloved student Jesse (Alex Wolff) goes missing, she’s quick on the case and when success knocks upon her door, she’s flooded with fans and fame.  There’s an element of the “search” as much as there is a degree of internal discovery as we learn more about Susie’s character.

Heading into Paris, he was in 10th place in the points race. But under the ATP’s Grand Slam champion rule, any player who wins a major title and is ranked within the top 20 is guaranteed a spot in the year-end championship. (The WTA Tour has no such rule, which is why Djokovic’s fellow Wimbledon champion, Elena Rybakina, did not qualify for the WTA Finals in Fort Worth.) “Most of the upheaval this year is because of Djokovic,” Patrick McEnroe, a former United States Davis Cup captain and now an ESPN commentator said. “He missed two majors and didn’t get points for the one he won.

By Radhika Seth On June 12, 2023, after enduring years of controversy, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the organization that founded the Golden Globes, announced that it would be closing. However, it seems this is not the end for the famously raucous ceremony, which has kicked off awards season for the past 80 years. Here’s everything you need to know about the 2024 Golden Globe Awards, and how we ended up here. By all accounts, yes. Eldridge Industries, a holding company owned by the billionaire investor Todd Boehly, and Dick Clark Productions, which has produced the Golden Globes telecast for decades, have reportedly agreed to purchase the HFPA’s Golden Globes assets, rights, and properties for an undisclosed price. They’ll form a new non-profit, the Golden Globe Foundation, which will continue the philanthropic work of the HFPA. (The organization has given more than $50 million to entertainment-related charities over the last 30 years.) Meanwhile, a yet-to-be-named for-profit entity will also seek to expand the Golden Globes as a brand.", "Planning and producing the Golden Globes ceremony annually will remain a focus, too. Earlier this year, the HFPA disclosed that the voting body for the 2024 competition will be comprised of 310 journalists from outside the US, a group which will include the organization’s 95 current members. In a statement, Dick Clark Productions’s CEO Jay Penske said: “As stewards of the Golden Globe Awards, our mission is to continue creating the most dynamic awards ceremony on live television viewed across the world. We have a great team in place to grow this iconic brand and captivate new and existing audiences to celebrate the very best in television and motion pictures.” The ceremony is currently scheduled for January 7, though there is not yet a broadcast partner for the awards show. It could feasibly end up on a major network or a streaming platform, as was the case for the SAG Awards, which aired live on Netflix’s  YouTube page earlier this year.

Nvidia’s choice to price the RTX 4090 the way it did was not the most popular decision it has ever made. After a couple of years of GPU shortage, most of us are tired of having to pay insane prices for our PC hardware. To see Nvidia not just continue that trend, but also tell its customers outright that cheaper GPUs are a thing of the past, was disheartening.

It’s worth noting that the Asus TUF RTX 4090 matches Nvidia’s $1,599 MSRP, so you won’t have to fork out more for the overclocked card. I’d argue the cooling efficacy of the model’s Axial-tech setup makes picking the variant over the original reference design worthwhile, but its extra chonk contributes to the GPU’s unattractive form.

In order to accomplish this, they tested the personalities for each character with a test group, who received the characters positively.[13] The writers also wanted to avoid portraying the Legion of Zoom as mere copies of their owners, to which they gave each vehicle their own characteristics, such as portraying Prank, the Joker's van, as \"a surfer dude\".[13]  The series' score was composed by Alex Geringas, while the theme song was performed and produced by Andy Sturmer,[12] who previously composed the themes for the series The Batman and Batman: The Brave and the Bold.
