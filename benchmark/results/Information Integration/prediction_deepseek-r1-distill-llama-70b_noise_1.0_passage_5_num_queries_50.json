Let me go through the document provided step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look for mentions of the 79th Golden Globes specifically. The document starts by talking about the TV side, mentioning Abbott Elementary winning best comedy and some other awards. Then it moves on to movies, talking about \"The Power of the Dog\" winning Best Picture Drama, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actor. That seems to be for the 79th Globes.\n\nNext, under the section for Best Television Series — Musical or Comedy, it says \"Hacks\" won that category and Jean Smart won Best Actress. Then, for Best Television Series — Drama, \"Succession\" won. So, for the 79th Globes, the Best Drama TV series was \"Succession,\" and the Best Musical/Comedy TV series was \"Hacks.\"\n\nLooking at the movies, under Best Picture Drama, \"The Power of the Dog\" won, and for Musical/Comedy movies, \"West Side Story\" won. \n\nWait, but the question is about both TV and film? Or just TV? The question says \"Best drama and best Musical/Comedy\" without specifying, but in the document, it's clear that \"Succession\" won Best Drama TV series and \"Hacks\" won Best Musical/Comedy TV series. For films, \"The Power of the Dog\" won Best Drama film, and \"West Side Story\" won Best Musical/Comedy film.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify TV or film. However, in the document, the user is asking about the 79th Golden Globes, and in that context, both TV and film categories are mentioned. So, to answer accurately, I should mention both.\n\nWait, but the document also mentions the 80th Golden Globes in another part, so I need to make sure I'm only considering the 79th. The 79th was held in 2022, I think, and the 80th in 2023. So, the first part of the document is about the 80th, and the latter part is about the 79th. Wait, no, actually, the document starts with the 80th because it mentions the 80th time in history, and then goes back to the 79th. Wait, no, the document starts with the 80th, as it says \"On Tuesday night, the Golden Globes were held for the 80th time in history,\" so that's the 80th. Then, further down, it talks about the 79th, like the Best Picture Drama: “The Power of the Dog” and Best Television Series — Comedy: “Hacks.”\n\nSo, the user's question is about the 79th Golden Globes. Therefore, I should extract the winners from the 79th, which are:\n\nBest Television Series — Drama: \"Succession\"\nBest Television Series — Musical or Comedy: \"Hacks\"\nBest Motion Picture — Drama: \"The Power of the Dog\"\nBest Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy: \"West Side Story\"\n\nBut the question is phrased as \"What won best drama and best Musical/Comedy at 79th Golden Globes?\" It doesn't specify whether it's for TV or film. So, I should probably include both.\n\nHowever, the way the question is phrased, it might be asking for both TV and film categories. So, the answer would include both.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is only asking about TV, but the document provides both. So, to be thorough, I should mention both.\n\nWait, the document is a bit confusing because it starts with the 80th, then goes back to the 79th. So, I need to make sure I'm pulling the correct info.\n\nIn the section about the 79th, under the \"Best Picture Drama\" section, it says \"The Power of the Dog\" won, and under \"Best Television Series — Musical or Comedy,\" \"Hacks\" won. Also, under \"Best Television Series — Drama,\" \"Succession\" won. Then, under \"Best Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy,\" \"West Side Story\" won.\n\nSo, the answer should list both TV and film categories for Drama and Musical/Comedy.\n\nBut the question is a bit ambiguous. It could be interpreted as asking for both TV and film, but if I have to choose, maybe the user is asking for film. Wait, no, the question is about the 79th Golden Globes, and the document provides both TV and film winners.\n\nSo, to answer correctly, I should mention both.\n\nBut wait, the question is phrased as \"What won best drama and best Musical/Comedy at 79th Golden Globes?\" without specifying TV or film. Therefore, I should answer both categories for TV and film.\n\nSo, the answer would be:\n\nFor TV:\n- Best Drama: Succession\n- Best Musical/Comedy: Hacks\n\nFor Film:\n- Best Drama: The Power of the Dog\n- Best Musical/Comedy: West Side Story\n\nBut perhaps the user is only asking for TV.

After Jerrod Carmichael explained to the audience at the Beverly Hilton how he wound up as the host (spoiler: \"I'm here because I'm Black,\" he quipped before launching into a detailed and honest account of his decision-making process), the trophy distribution began. The Banshees of Inisherin, which led all movies with eight nominations, struck up a meaningful friendship with Globes voters over the evening: The Irish-island-set tragicomedy took home the best comedy film trophy, while Colin Farrell triumphed in the acting category and writer-director Martin McDonagh won for best screenplay. The Fablemans also came into frame by winning best drama film honors and best director (Steven Spielberg). Meanwhile, Everything Everywhere All at Once prevailed in two dimensions, as Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan netted acting trophies.", "Concerns about the lack of diversity in the HFPA board and the award nominees were brought up last year, and similar concerns were still brought up this year.

While the HFPA has announced new policies for diversity, equity and inclusion, and inducted 21 new members, including several people of color as well as the addition of Neil Phillips as chief diversity officer, the future of the Golden Globes still remains uncertain.

The Big Air snowboarding and freestyle skiing events were held in a former industrial area in Shijingshan District, at Western Hills area.[18] Since the end of 2009, the Beijing Olympic Village apartments on the Olympic Green had been transformed into a residential area. There was therefore a need to build another Olympic Village on a smaller scale for the Winter Olympics. These new buildings are located in the southern area of Olympic Green on the neighbourhood of the National Olympic Sports Center and will serves as Chinese Olympic Committee residential complex for those athletes who will undergo training sessions at the nearby venues.[19]", "Feb 4, 2022 ...

We're still in the final days of the Tokyo Summer Olympics — but thanks to the one-year delay of these Games, the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics are now less than six months away. \"All venues and facilities for Beijing 2022 are close to complete,\" organizers said in a recent update.  Those structures range from luge tracks and skating rinks to snowboard courses. The 12 ice and snow venues are scattered between Beijing and neighboring Hebei province, which includes a large mountain resort. Test events were held at those venues this year to fine-tune them for  competition, organizers said. While many facilities are brand-new, some may look familiar: The famous \"Water Cube\" that hosted Olympic swimming in 2008, for instance, is now the \"Ice Cube,\" to host curling.", "On 19 February 2021, it was announced that Russia would compete under the acronym \"ROC\" after the name of the Russian Olympic Committee although the name of the committee itself in full could not be used to refer to the delegation. Russia would be represented by the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee.[76]  On 8 September 2021, the IOC Executive Board suspended the Olympic Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) through at least the end of 2022 for violations of the Olympic Charter, over its refusal to send athletes to the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo due to COVID-19 pandemic-related concerns. North Korean athletes would be allowed to participate under the Olympic flag.[77][78][79][80] However, North Korean Ministry of Sports and the National Olympic Committee said in a letter to the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics Organizing Committee, the Chinese Olympic Committee, and the General Administration of Sport of China on 7 January 2022 that \"Due to the \"action of hostile forces\" and the COVID-19 pandemic, they would not be able to participate in the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.\"[81] In addition, the North Korean Olympic Committee said \"supports all the work of our comrades in China to host a grand and wonderful Olympics."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

So, it's correct to say Los Angeles as the location, but more precisely, Inglewood. However, the document refers to it as Los Angeles, so I'll go with that.\n\nPutting it all together, the Super Bowl in 2022 was on February 13th at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, California.

Nao Kodaira, the 2018 gold medalist, finished 17th, so she didn't win this time. Brittany Bowe and Kimi Goetz are mentioned as teammates but didn't win. So, Erin Jackson is the women's 500m gold medalist.\n\nNext, for the men's 500m, the document mentions Gao Tingyu from China winning the gold. It specifically states, \"Gao Tingyu claimed #SpeedSkating - men's 500m #gold at the Beijing 2022 Olympics.\" That's a clear indication that he won the men's event.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information in the documents about these winners, so I can confidently provide these answers.\n</think>\n\nThe winners of the 500m speed skating events at the 2022 Winter Olympics were:\n\n- **Women's 500m**: Erin Jackson (USA)\n- **Men's 500m**: Gao Tingyu (China)", "docs": ["Takagi is the second Japanese athlete to earn a medal in the women's 500m since 1998.  Speed skating returns on Tuesday with the men's and women's team pursuit semifinal and final rounds.  See the full speed skating schedule here.

Google I/O 2022 will be held on May 11 and May 12 at the Shoreline Amphitheater. The event will kick off with Sundar Pichai’s “Google I/O keynote” at 10 AM. This will be the main attraction for the general population as the main event tends to be more consumer-focused. While the event’s description doesn’t provide specifics, expect to see announcements for popular Google services, Workspace, privacy, health, and Google’s other new projects and endeavors. Also, keep an eye out for potential hardware announcements in the form of the Pixel 6a, Pixel Watch, and smart home devices. The main keynote will be followed by the Developer keynote and “What’s new in Android.” This is where we expect to learn more about Android 13, Wear OS, and updates to developer products and tools.

It is her third Grand Slam title and first on a surface other than clay. By Matthew Futterman The 2022 U.S. Open will always be remembered — outside of Poland, at least — for its farewell to Serena Williams, long the queen of tennis and the greatest women’s player ever. Beware, though, after Poland’s Iga Swiatek won the women’s singles title Saturday, beating Ons Jabeur of Tunisia Saturday afternoon at Arthur Ashe Stadium, the sport may have a new ruler on its hands. Swiatek, the world No. 1, lived up to her billing and beat Jabeur, 6-2, 7-6(5), to capture her first U.S. Open singles title. It was the third Grand Slam title of Swiatek’s brief career and her first on a surface other than clay.

With the win, Świątek extended her winning streak to 35 matches (dating back to the Qatar Open in February), equaling Venus Williams' tally from the 2000 season.[2] Świątek also became the youngest winner of multiple majors since Maria Sharapova in 2006.[3]  Barbora Krejčíková was the defending champion,[4] but she lost in the first round to Diane Parry. This marked only the third time in French Open history that the defending champion lost in the first round (after Anastasia Myskina in 2005 and Jeļena Ostapenko in 2018), and the record fifteenth consecutive unsuccessful French Open women's singles title defense since 2007.[5]  17-year-old Linda Nosková became the youngest qualifier to debut in the main draw since Michelle Larcher de Brito in 2009.[6][7][8][9] This was the second time in the Open Era when only one out of the top ten seeds advanced to the fourth round of a major, after 2018 Wimbledon.[10]", "Gauff, an 18-year-old from Delray Beach, Florida, was disappointed after the loss, but talked about how this match -- and her run to the final -- has helped boost her confidence. \"For a while I really believed I couldn't do it just because ever since I was 15 and I first came on people had so much expectations for me and I started to believe that I couldn't do it and you know I made a final and I wasn't expecting it and I know that I'll get this opportunity again and I hope that I can come out on top next time. The numbers tell the story of a dominant and composed match for Swiatek -- which was the story of her tournament and could be the tag line for her last three months of tennis. 73% first serves in, 72% win rate on first serves, 5-for-10 in break point chances, just 16 unforced errors. On the other side of the court Gauff struggled on her first serve, winning just 46% of her first serve points and coming away with three double faults and 23 unforced errors and 21 forced errors.

So I just wanted to take it step by step. I didn’t have any exact goals on this tournament.

Under Djokovic, it says he won five titles: one major, ATP Finals, one 1000, one 500, and one 250. So, Djokovic won five titles in 2022.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many titles each of them won. From the information gathered, Swiatek won eight titles and Djokovic won five titles in the 2022 season. \n\nI should make sure there's no conflicting information in the documents.

During her mind-blowing 37-match win streak, the first 19 of said victories were on the surface and she earned three 1000-level hard-court titles (Qatar, Indian Wells, Miami) during that run. Swiatek reached the semifinals in Melbourne last season and is perhaps the biggest women's favorite to win a major title since Serena in her prime. Not to mention, the US Open victory gave her an extra dose of confidence about her game. \"It's a confirmation for me that [the] sky is the limit,\" she said in September. Swiatek started the 2023 season by leading the Polish team to the semifinals at the United Cup and recording straight-sets victories in her first three singles matches, including against Belinda Bencic. Although she was handed a stunning 6-2, 6-2 loss by Jessica Pegula in the semis, the normally unflappable Swiatek will likely use that as motivation in Melbourne.", "\"Obviously what happened 12 months ago was not easy for me, for my family, team, anybody who is close to me ...\" Djokovic said. \"You can't forget those events.

But it is a valuable life experience for me and something that as I said will stay there, but I have to move on.\" If Djokovic were to win, he would tie Nadal with 22 major titles, and be just one behind Serena Williams for the most in the Open era. As if there wasn't enough already on the line for him or anything. Prior to Carlos Alcaraz's withdrawal last week due to a right leg injury, it looked as if both of the reigning US Open champions would be looking for back-to-back major titles. But alas, that is not to be. But while Alcaraz won't be there, Swiatek certainly will be, and she will be attempting to cement her status as the heir apparent for tennis' superstar title.

The user is asking who stars as Susie Wallis and who directed \"Susie Searches.\" \n\nLooking at the provided documents, I see multiple mentions of the lead actress. In the first document, it's mentioned that Kiersey Clemons stars as Susie. The second document also confirms this, noting that Kiersey Clemons replaced Kargman as the lead. So, Kiersey Clemons is the actress playing Susie Wallis.\n\nNext, for the director, the document mentions Sophie Kargman as the screenwriter and also refers to her in the context of the film, but it doesn't explicitly state her role as the director. However, in the credits section at the end, under crew, Sophie Kargman is listed as the screenwriter, and there's no mention of a director. Wait, actually, looking again, the first document discusses Kargman and William Day Frank reimagining the concept, suggesting they might be involved in directing. But the credits list doesn't include a director. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. \n\nWait, in the first document, it says \"Kargman and Day Frank have smartly pivoted...\" which might imply they are the writers or possibly co-directors. But in the credits, only Sophie Kargman is listed as the screenwriter. There's no director mentioned. Maybe the director's name isn't provided here, or perhaps Sophie Kargman also directed it. Alternatively, the director could be someone else not listed in the documents. Since the documents don't specify the director, I might have to say the information isn't available.\n\nBut wait, in the initial part, it's mentioned that Kargman and Day Frank pivoted the conceit for a feature film, but it doesn't clearly state their roles. The credits only list Kargman as the screenwriter, so without explicit mention of the director, I can't assume she directed it. Therefore, the director's name isn't provided in the documents.\n\nSo, the answer is Kiersey Clemons stars as Susie Wallis, and the director isn't mentioned in the documents.\n</think>\n\nKiersey Clemons stars as Susie Wallis in \"Susie Searches.\" The director of the film is not specified in the provided documents.", "docs": ["In 2020's \"Susie Searches,\" she also starred as the brace-faced sleuth. However, in re-imaging the conceit for a feature-length film, she and William Day Frank have smartly pivoted to build a string of reveals that keeps the macabre thrills coming. Admittedly, these jolts can make the movie feel episodic, leading me to wonder if they'd initially conceived of this as a web series or TV show. In the right headspace, this uneven ride can feel like binge-watching an addictive limited series. And, frankly, I value the rough edges when they come with such unexpected fun.  For the first act, Susie Searches runs the risk of feeling dated, presenting an amateur detective in the guileless light of literal kids stuff, like Harriet the Spy or Scooby Doo. At this point, we've been so glutted with crime shows that this tact feels tired. However, as Susie solves her mystery, the movie moves into motivations, urging the audience to reconsider their heroine, to re-examine the clues, and to question whether what we want is justice or just a good story.  Kargman and Day weave together a deceptively chipper tone with a cynical thread and an appetite for tension for a finale that is outrageous and rewarding.", "Sep 13, 2022 ...

What does she really want? What are her motivations? She’s a meticulous girl and nothing, even early on before we get to the real discoveries, seem happen-chance.The color schemes and cinematography by Conor Murphy deliver an intriguing perspective as we keep Susie in our own investigative sights. Jon Natchez composes a score that accompanies the ups and downs of our protagonist’s moods ensuring that the thrilling nature of the story is pronounced.What occurs after is most enjoyed by the discovery but ends up being both light-hearted and fun, obsessive and sad. Susie isn’t a selfless character, nearly not likable on paper, but Clemons insists that she is. That strength in conviction makes Susie Searches much more, and  Clemon’s affable demeanor helps elevate it.There are also some terrific supporting comedic roles with sheriff Jim Gaffigan and Ken Marino, both are winningly charming (or disconcerting) in their own ways.  Also shoutout to Rachel Sennott as Susie’s co-worker, stealing most scenes that she is in.", "Susie Searches is thus a quirky look at the destructive nature of popularity and the collateral damage that results when its preservation becomes more important than being “good.” I would question whether it’s able to sustain its initial enjoyment level, though—the whole is more cutely biting than uproariously funny, and such tone can prove tiring if the narrative doesn’t find a new gear to drive things forward. When it’s just Susie having to confront the reality that her choices have sent her into a freefall necessitating an embracement of the unethical, things get stale no matter how endearing or effective the characterizations prove. And Anne becoming non-verbal seems a missed opportunity once Susie’s prime suspect is found innocent. Only she knows her daughter is never wrong. Thus we’re left in limbo. Susie operates out of pragmatism, not malice. We can’t “enjoy” her choices as much as wince in anticipation of her inevitable comeuppance because she’s not an anti-hero. We’re not supposed to give her the benefit of the doubt. By not having Anne as a logical point of conflict, however, there’s no one else to sustainably root for. Maybe Loggins or Jessie’s suspicious friend Ray (Isaac Powell), but they become more red herring or potential victim than any real adversarial threat.

The figure was down from the 8.5% mark recorded in July and the 9.1% inflation rate in June, which was the biggest increase in four decades.  Even as U.S. motorists have gladly watched gasoline prices fall sharply in recent weeks — down 10.6% from their peak — costs for food and apartment rentals have continued to increase.  Overall, as a result, the government said that consumer prices were up one-tenth of a percent in August, compared to July.  Food prices were up 0.8 percent in the past month, while costs for housing, medical care, new cars and household furnishings all increased in August compared to July.

Let me look through the documents provided to find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I see that there are mentions of ACL Festival and ACL 2023 in different contexts. One document says that ACL Festival will take place at Zilker Park in Austin, TX, over two weekends in October 2023. It specifically mentions October 6-8 and 13-15. Another document mentions that ACL 2023 will be at the Westin Harbour Castle in Toronto, Canada, with an address and phone number. \n\nWait, that seems conflicting. One event is in Austin, TX, and another is in Toronto, Canada. But both are referred to as ACL 2023. I also see a mention of Apple sponsoring the annual meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), which is scheduled for July 9, but the exact location isn't provided here.\n\nSo, I'm a bit confused. Are there two separate events with the same name? One is a festival in Austin, and the other is a conference in Toronto? Or is there a mistake in the documents? The user is asking for when and where ACL 2023 is taking place, but without more context, it's unclear which ACL they're referring to.\n\nI should check each document again. The first document talks about ACL Festival in Zilker Park, Austin, TX, in October 2023. The second document mentions ACL 2023 in Toronto, Canada, at a specific hotel. The third document refers to ACL as the Association for Computational Linguistics, sponsored by Apple, happening in July, but the location isn't specified.\n\nSo, it's possible that ACL refers to two different events: a music festival in Austin and a computational linguistics conference in Toronto. The user might be asking about one of these, but without more context, I can't be sure. However, the documents do provide information about both events, so I can mention both.\n\nWait, but the user's question is about when and where ACL 2023 is taking place. Since the documents mention two different locations and possibly two different events, I should clarify that. So, ACL Festival is in Austin, TX, in October, and ACL 2023 (the conference) is in Toronto in July. But the conference's exact dates aren't given except for July 9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Toronto event is a different ACL. The user might be referring to the music festival, which is clearly in Austin in October. But the document also mentions a conference in Toronto. So, I should probably list both to cover all possibilities.\n\nBut wait, the user's question is specifically about ACL 2023. If ACL can refer to both the festival and the conference, then both are correct. However, the conference is usually known as the Association for Computational Linguistics, while the festival is Austin City Limits Festival. So, perhaps the user is referring to the festival, which is in Austin.\n\nBut the document also mentions a Toronto event titled ACL 2023, which might be confusing. So, to be thorough, I should mention both possibilities, but clarify that ACL can refer to different events.\n\nWait, but the user's question is straightforward: when and where is ACL 2023 taking place? So, based on the documents, the festival is in Austin in October, and there's another event in Toronto, but the dates for Toronto aren't fully specified beyond July 9.\n\nSo, I think the best approach is to provide both pieces of information, noting that ACL can refer to different events. However, since the question is about ACL 2023, and the documents provide two locations, I should present both, but maybe the user is referring to the festival.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Toronto event is a mistake because the festival is well-known to be in Austin. But I can't assume that; I have to go by the documents. So, I'll state both possibilities based on the provided information.\n</think>\n\nThe ACL 2023 events are taking place in two different locations:\n\n1. **ACL Festival (Austin City Limits Music Festival)**: This event will occur at Zilker Park in Austin, TX, over two weekends: October 6-8 and October 13-15, 2023.\n\n2. **ACL 2023 (Association for Computational Linguistics Conference)**: This conference is scheduled to take place in Toronto, Canada, at the Westin Harbour Castle, with the specific dates not fully detailed beyond July 9, 2023.\n\nThus, depending on the context, ACL 2023 refers to either the music festival in Austin or the computational linguistics conference in Toronto.", "docs": ["Taking place at Zilker Park in Austin, TX, ACL Festival has grown to 2 weekends, 9 stages and 100+ performances.

Codenamed “Operation London Bridge,” arrangements for Britain’s longest-serving monarch have been carefully pored over for years by the many agencies involved, with the Queen herself signing off on every single detail before her death. However, these details were kept under wraps until the sitting sovereign, King Charles III, gave it all his final seal of approval.            The Queen will ultimately be laid to rest within St. George’s Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle, alongside her “strength and stay” of 73 years, Prince Philip. Here, we’ve put together a day-by-day guide on what will happen from now until the state funeral.

On Sunday morning, gamekeepers carried it to a waiting hearse, and then the beloved monarch left Balmoral for the last time.

At 4:00 p.m. (11:00 a.m. Eastern): A committal service will take place, with about 800 people attending. Guests will include members of the queen's household.

Now that the organization has outlined its plans for reform, publicists and agents say that some stars are open to participating, while others want the Globes to be permanently retired.

By Radhika Seth On June 12, 2023, after enduring years of controversy, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the organization that founded the Golden Globes, announced that it would be closing. However, it seems this is not the end for the famously raucous ceremony, which has kicked off awards season for the past 80 years. Here’s everything you need to know about the 2024 Golden Globe Awards, and how we ended up here. By all accounts, yes. Eldridge Industries, a holding company owned by the billionaire investor Todd Boehly, and Dick Clark Productions, which has produced the Golden Globes telecast for decades, have reportedly agreed to purchase the HFPA’s Golden Globes assets, rights, and properties for an undisclosed price. They’ll form a new non-profit, the Golden Globe Foundation, which will continue the philanthropic work of the HFPA. (The organization has given more than $50 million to entertainment-related charities over the last 30 years.) Meanwhile, a yet-to-be-named for-profit entity will also seek to expand the Golden Globes as a brand.", "Appearing recently on NBC’s “Tonight Show,” Carmichael took aim at the network as well as the awards show, and said it was his idea — along with NBC’s “lazy and pushy” marketing team — to brand the ceremony as an “evening of joy and devastation.”  Awards  The best looks from the 2023 Golden Globes, including Ana de Armas, Viola Davis and Jenna Ortega.

She shared her appreciation at getting the chance to play this role, and even revealed the name of her character. \"Very proud to represent my fellow middle eastern brothers and sisters as Adrianna,\" Shahi wrote. DC fans will recognize the name Adrianna and associate it with Adrianna Tomaz, Black Adam's wife and the hero Isis. You can see Shahi's full post down below. Adrianna has long been rumored to be a part of Black Adam, so it isn't too surprising that Shahi is actually playing her. However, her role as Adrianna seemingly also confirms the film will feature Isis. In the comics, Adrianna possess the Amulet of Isis, which bestows her with the powers of the goddess. It would make sense for Black Adam to show Adrianna in her superpowered form, perhaps suiting up alongside her husband for an epic battle. Of course, there are bound to be some changes in how Black Adam depicts Adrianna. For one thing, superhero movies these days are always putting some new spins on characters. For another, Shahi's initial casting described her character as \"a university professor and freedom fighter leading the resistance in Kahndaq.", "She also does not go by “Isis,” because by then the militant organization ISIS was too prominent for anyone to be comfortable with the name; given the different name, powers, history, and lack of codename, I suspect even a lot of comics fans never connected her to the character in the comics. Zari is eventually erased from the timeline and replaced by Zari Tarazi, an alternate version of the character played by the same actress, who is basically a socialite from the future, because Legends was a delightfully bananas show and I miss it every day. And now we have the cinematic version of the character in Black Adam: Adrianna Tomaz, a university professor and resistance fighter in Kahndaq. Obviously this is different than any version we’ve seen before, although she skews closest to the comics version. At the time of this writing, I haven’t seen the movie, so I can’t say whether Adrianna will fall in love with Adam, or get powers, or [redacted horrible things from circa 2008]. Hopefully not that last part. No matter what story Adrianna gets in the movie, she’s had an interesting journey to get there. There have certainly been missteps, like the whitewashing in the ’70s, and a whole heap of misogynistic tropes in the late 2000s. But she’s still an important figure in superhero history who rarely gets her due.", "Perhaps Black Adam's Adrianna/Isis has been separated from Adam, and part of the story will feature their reunion. Right now, the film's plot is still being kept under wraps, so everything is speculation. Still, come next year, audiences just might meet the goddess Isis on the big screen.", "Over the years, she's had supporting roles in Person of Interest, Chicago Fire, and City on a Hill. Shahi will be seen as Adrianna Tomaz, aka Isis, in the widely anticipated DC film Black Adam. One of the film's most fascinating aspects is Black Adam's relationship with Adrianna Tomaz. Regarding her role in the film, Sarah Shahi said during an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Adrianna Tomaz has a brother named Karim, played by actor Mohammed Amer. Not many other plot details are known at this point, but it'll be interesting to see how Adrianna Tomaz's role as Black Adam's love interest pans out in the film. Black Adam chronicles the eventful story of the titular character who returns to the modern world after centuries of imprisonment and teams up with the Justice Society of America (JSA). Here's the official synopsis of the movie, as per DC: The film's initial reactions have been mostly positive, with praise majorly directed towards the thrilling action sequences and ambitious plot.

Though, remember that these are leaked benchmarks, are by no means official, and can change compared to the final product. The RTX 4090 is available at all good electronics retailers. Though, we’ve seen many of them already go live, and have listed where you can buy these upcoming GPUs earlier in this article.  It’s likely that we will see more AIB cards hit the market after the initial launch, from the likes of companies like PALIT and more. However, these are likely to come some weeks after launch, possibly due to logistical reasons.", "The RTX 4090 also possesses a higher MSRP than the RTX 3090, which was launched at $1499. This bump of $100 is actually fairly good pricing, considering inflation in the subsequent years, too.  It’s tough to tell what demand might look like for the RTX 4090, but since it will retain Nvidia’s power crown, and will potentially be one of the best graphics cards in 2023. The RTX 4090 was released on October 12. However, while Nvidia enjoys the launch of the 4090, its 30-series cards are now gaining even more popularity.  Due to an oversupply, Nvidia has cut the price of current-generation high-end graphics cards, and the newer RTX 40-series GPUs are priced slightly higher.  The RTX 4090 manages to boast incredibly impressive specifications on paper, with even more impressive results in gaming scenarios like in Overwatch 2. We’ve listed the full specifications of the 4090 below. You’ll be able to find extensive benchmarks of the GPU in our full review.  According to Nvidia’s own benchmarks, the GPU can produce the following results compared against a system using an i9-12900k, equipped with a 3090 Ti with 32GB of RAM. Nvidia released further information on performance that you can expect out of Overwatch 2 using the GPU, we’ve listed their results below.", "The RTX 4090 is the world’s fastest gaming GPU with astonishing power, acoustics and temperature characteristics. In full ray-traced games, the RTX 4090 with DLSS 3 is up to 4x faster compared to last generation’s RTX 3090 Ti with DLSS 2. It is also up to 2x faster in today’s games while maintaining the same 450W power consumption. It features 76 billion transistors, 16,384 CUDA® cores and 24GB of high-speed Micron GDDR6X memory, and consistently delivers over 100 frames per second at 4K-resolution gaming. The RTX 4090 will be available on Wednesday, Oct. 12, starting at $1,599. The company also announced the RTX 4080, launching in two configurations. The RTX 4080 16GB has 9,728 CUDA cores and 16GB of high-speed Micron GDDR6X memory, and with DLSS 3 is 2x as fast in today’s games as the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and more powerful than the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti at lower power. The RTX 4080 12GB has 7,680 CUDA cores and 12GB of Micron GDDR6X memory, and with DLSS 3 is faster than the RTX 3090 Ti, the previous-generation flagship GPU.", "For today’s standards, it’s almost too good; so much so that it’s begging for a new AAA game to come out and fully take advantage of it. It also costs $1,600 for the Founders Edition, but you’ll find many versions of the card up for sale for $2,000 to $2,500. Nvidia’s choice to price the RTX 4090 the way it did was not the most popular decision it has ever made. After a couple of years of GPU shortage, most of us are tired of having to pay insane prices for our PC hardware. To see Nvidia not just continue that trend, but also tell its customers outright that cheaper GPUs are a thing of the past, was disheartening. Still, the RTX 4090 sold out and came back at scalper prices, with some eBay sales on launch day reaching as high as $5,000. There was a single sale for $9,999, but it’s hard to believe that this was a legitimate purchase. The insanity of these prices made some of us actually look forward to the (also overpriced) RTX 4080, set with an MSRP (recommended price) of $1,200. Unfortunately, once the card arrived, the taste of excitement grew bitter with a large heap of disappointment."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

In order to accomplish this, they tested the personalities for each character with a test group, who received the characters positively.[13] The writers also wanted to avoid portraying the Legion of Zoom as mere copies of their owners, to which they gave each vehicle their own characteristics, such as portraying Prank, the Joker's van, as \"a surfer dude\".[13]  The series' score was composed by Alex Geringas, while the theme song was performed and produced by Andy Sturmer,[12] who previously composed the themes for the series The Batman and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. Sturmer also co-wrote the theme alongside Stern.[12]", "\"We wanted to make sure that we weren’t underestimating them and treat them as normal growing brains.\" Once regarded as unsophisticated media, the last few years have seen a greater appreciation of programs aimed towards preschool and young audiences such as the various lauded shows on Disney and Nickelodeon Junior blocks of programming. Taking a page from the same playbook, WarnerMedia has debuted the Batwheels cartoon, DC’s first-ever Batman preschool series that follows the Batman Family along with his amazing team of super-vehicles offering young viewers a high-speed, vibrant CGI-animated iteration of the Caped Crusader. During New York Comic Con we had the chance to chat with some of the talent behind this high-speed, vibrant CGI-animated series including executive producers Michael G. Stern and Simon J. Smith as well as voice actors Jacob Bertrand (Bam), Lilimar (Batwing), Xolo Maridueña (Snowy), and AJ Hudson (Duke Thomas/Robin). Taimur Dar: When this Batwheels cartoon was first announced, the concept of talking vehicles definitely reminded me of shows I grew up watching like Thomas the Tank Engine. I’m curious how this show came about?  Michael G. Stern: DC and Warner Bros. Animation had wanted to find a way to connect young kids to their heroes and they had sort of been struggling to do it. They brought me in and I looked at what had been done before for this age group."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}
