This year's show was held on 10 May 2023 as a hybrid event with a limited live audience and online access for everyone. Here's everything you need to know about Google I/O 2023. Google I/O is an annual developer conference hosted by Google, where the company showcases its latest technologies and products. The conference typically features keynote speeches, technical sessions, and product announcements, and attracts both developers and consumers. Google announced Google I/O 2023 through a blog post on the official Google Developers website in March. The post revealed the dates and format of the event and invited interested attendees to register for the event. The announcement was also shared on Google's social media channels. Like previous years, Google also teased the event with a binary field puzzle that fans had to solve to reveal the launch date. Googgle I/O 20213 took place on 10 May. The keynote occurred at 10am PT and lasted about two hours. Google I/O 2023 was broadcast online and is still available to everyone to watch.

In the decades since, we’ve been developing our technology to deliver on that mission. The progress we've made is because of our years of investment in advanced technologies, from AI to the technical infrastructure that powers it all. And once a year — on my favorite day of the year :) — we share an update on how it’s going at Google I/O. Today, I talked about how we’re advancing two fundamental aspects of our mission — knowledge and computing — to create products that are built to help. It’s exciting to build these products; it’s even more exciting to see what people do with them. Thank you to everyone who helps us do this work, and most especially our Googlers. We are grateful for the opportunity. - Sundar  Editor’s note: Below is an edited transcript of Sundar Pichai's keynote address during the opening of today's Google I/O Developers Conference.

To the thousands of developers, partners and Googlers here with us, it’s great to see all of you.", "Google I/O 2023 is expected to see the launch of new Pixel devices, AI tools, and more. Here's the complete lowdown, and how you can watch yourself. Google I/O is a developer event that always opens with a keynote during which Google unveils a host of new hardware and software products. Many fans are waiting to see what the company will unveil in 2023. If you're one of them, here's what you can expect to see, and how you can watch the event online when it airs on May 10th. Google I/O 2023 is scheduled for Wednesday, May 10th, and will take place at Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California. The in-person event will be hosted live for a small audience, but you can watch it online when it airs on the Google I/O website or head over to Google's YouTube channel. Although Google I/O is meant primarily for developers, the opening keynote will unveil the company's latest consumer products and services, and perhaps even a sneak peek into products coming later this year. Google hasn't officially revealed what it plans to show at I/O, but we can make some smart guesses based on things Google revealed at I/O 2022 last year and credible rumors. Here are some of the things we expect to see at Google I/O 2023.", "All keynotes and product announcements will take place on day one, while on-demand technical sessions will go live on day two. Here's the list of major keynotes and sessions that will take place on day 1: You can check out the full schedule for all sessions and keynotes at the Google I/O website.

Read on to know more. We’re just two weeks away from Google I/O 2022. While the yearly event is primarily targeted at developers, there will be plenty of fun stuff for enthusiasts and the general public. Google usually doesn’t reveal much about what it plans to announce at the event. However, the company has now released the Google I/O 2022 schedule, giving us a brief overview of what to expect. Google I/O 2022 will be held on May 11 and May 12 at the Shoreline Amphitheater. The event will kick off with Sundar Pichai’s “Google I/O keynote” at 10 AM. This will be the main attraction for the general population as the main event tends to be more consumer-focused. While the event’s description doesn’t provide specifics, expect to see announcements for popular Google services, Workspace, privacy, health, and Google’s other new projects and endeavors. Also, keep an eye out for potential hardware announcements in the form of the Pixel 6a, Pixel Watch, and smart home devices. The main keynote will be followed by the Developer keynote and “What’s new in Android.” This is where we expect to learn more about Android 13, Wear OS, and updates to developer products and tools.

Macron’s polling lead had been increasing in the days before the runoff, and France’s ban on publishing new polls after Friday night would have prevented fully capturing that surge. “The result is very disappointing for [Le Pen],” said Vincent Martigny, a political scientist at the University of Nice. “She ended up very far from power.", "On 8 November 2020, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, founder of La France Insoumise (LFI), announced that he would be running in the election.

The use of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is what makes ChatGPT especially unique.  Through RLHF, human AI trainers provided the model with conversations in which they played both parts, the user and AI assistants, according to OpenAI.  ChatGPT is a language model created to hold a conversation with the end user. A search engine indexes web pages on the internet to help the user find the information they asked for. The free version of ChatGPT does not have the ability to search the internet for information. It uses the information it learned from training data to generate a response, which leaves room for error.  Also: ChatGPT or Google: Which gives the best answers? Another major difference is that ChatGPT only has access to information up to 2021, whereas a regular search engine like Google has access to the latest information.", "15] There have been previous reports of ChatGPT users discovering how to write jailbreaking prompts to trick ChatGPT to adopt a fictional persona named “DAN” (“Do Anything Now”) so that ChatGPT would display responses that the model can generate but OpenAI may have intended to be excluded from ChatGPT’s response.[16] OpenAI uses a mix of reviewers and automated systems to identify and enforce against misuse of its models and develop patches to prevent future jailbreaks.[17] OpenAI emphasizes in the GPT-4 Technical Report that GPT-4 users should take “great care” when using GPT-4’s outputs. OpenAI also recommends that users of GPT-4 establish protocols that match the needs of the user’s specific application of GPT-4 (such as “human review, grounding with additional context, or avoiding high-stakes uses altogether”).[18] As President and Co-Founder of OpenAI Greg Brockman said during the March 14, 2023 developer demo live stream, GPT-4 works best when used in tandem with people who check its work—it is “an amplifying tool” that when used together with humans allows us to “reach new heights,” but it “is not perfect” and neither are humans.

When it’s just Susie having to confront the reality that her choices have sent her into a freefall necessitating an embracement of the unethical, things get stale no matter how endearing or effective the characterizations prove.

It’s not apples to apples like other years.” Under the normal points system, Djokovic might not even qualify for the ATP Finals in Turin, Italy, this year. Heading into Paris, he was in 10th place in the points race. But under the ATP’s Grand Slam champion rule, any player who wins a major title and is ranked within the top 20 is guaranteed a spot in the year-end championship. (The WTA Tour has no such rule, which is why Djokovic’s fellow Wimbledon champion, Elena Rybakina, did not qualify for the WTA Finals in Fort Worth.) “Most of the upheaval this year is because of Djokovic,” Patrick McEnroe, a former United States Davis Cup captain and now an ESPN commentator said. “He missed two majors and didn’t get points for the one he won. It really affected the rest of the field. You could make the case that if Djokovic runs the table, wins Paris and the ATP Finals, that he deserves to be No. 1.” The player most likely to end 2022 at No. 1 is Alcaraz.

By Radhika Seth On June 12, 2023, after enduring years of controversy, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the organization that founded the Golden Globes, announced that it would be closing. However, it seems this is not the end for the famously raucous ceremony, which has kicked off awards season for the past 80 years. Here’s everything you need to know about the 2024 Golden Globe Awards, and how we ended up here. By all accounts, yes. Eldridge Industries, a holding company owned by the billionaire investor Todd Boehly, and Dick Clark Productions, which has produced the Golden Globes telecast for decades, have reportedly agreed to purchase the HFPA’s Golden Globes assets, rights, and properties for an undisclosed price. They’ll form a new non-profit, the Golden Globe Foundation, which will continue the philanthropic work of the HFPA. (The organization has given more than $50 million to entertainment-related charities over the last 30 years.) Meanwhile, a yet-to-be-named for-profit entity will also seek to expand the Golden Globes as a brand.", "Create a free profile to get unlimited access to exclusive show news, updates, and more!

Here are the nominees.   Given Hollywood’s aloof response to the nominations, it’s almost surprising how many stars have agreed to come out for the glittery affair.

Meanwhile, actor and comedian Eddie Murphy will be given the 2023 Cecil B.", "Planning and producing the Golden Globes ceremony annually will remain a focus, too. Earlier this year, the HFPA disclosed that the voting body for the 2024 competition will be comprised of 310 journalists from outside the US, a group which will include the organization’s 95 current members. In a statement, Dick Clark Productions’s CEO Jay Penske said: “As stewards of the Golden Globe Awards, our mission is to continue creating the most dynamic awards ceremony on live television viewed across the world. We have a great team in place to grow this iconic brand and captivate new and existing audiences to celebrate the very best in television and motion pictures.” The ceremony is currently scheduled for January 7, though there is not yet a broadcast partner for the awards show. It could feasibly end up on a major network or a streaming platform, as was the case for the SAG Awards, which aired live on Netflix’s  YouTube page earlier this year. On February 21, 2021, a Los Angeles Times investigation accused the HFPA of “self-dealing” and highlighted potential conflicts of interest. Among them was the fact that 30 HFPA members had been flown to France to visit the set of Emily in Paris in 2019.

During New York Comic Con we had the chance to chat with some of the talent behind this high-speed, vibrant CGI-animated series including executive producers Michael G. Stern and Simon J. Smith as well as voice actors Jacob Bertrand (Bam), Lilimar (Batwing), Xolo Maridueña (Snowy), and AJ Hudson (Duke Thomas/Robin). Taimur Dar: When this Batwheels cartoon was first announced, the concept of talking vehicles definitely reminded me of shows I grew up watching like Thomas the Tank Engine. I’m curious how this show came about?  Michael G. Stern: DC and Warner Bros. Animation had wanted to find a way to connect young kids to their heroes and they had sort of been struggling to do it.
