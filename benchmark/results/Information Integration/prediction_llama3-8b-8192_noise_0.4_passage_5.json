They mounted comebacks and as a result, the Bengals will have a chance to win their first Super Bowl in franchise history in their first appearance since 1989.

The Nobel Prize in physics for 2022 is being awarded to Alain Aspect, John F.

The 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded “for experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities, and pioneering quantum information science,” the academy said. The 2022 physics laureates’ development of experimental tools has laid the foundation for a new era of quantum technology. Being able to manipulate and manage quantum states and all their layers of properties gives us access to tools with unexpected potential.  Intense research and development are underway to utilise the special properties of individual particle systems to construct quantum computers, improve measurements, build quantum networks and establish secure quantum encrypted communication. This year’s Nobel Prize laureate John Clauser built an apparatus that emitted two entangled photons at a time, each towards a filter that tested their polarisation. The result was a clear violation of a Bell inequality and agreed with the predictions of quantum mechanics.", "Sharpless awarded his second Nobel Prize in Chemistry–one of only two chemists to ever receive such an honor.

In the decades since, we’ve been developing our technology to deliver on that mission.

And once a year — on my favorite day of the year :) — we share an update on how it’s going at Google I/O. Today, I talked about how we’re advancing two fundamental aspects of our mission — knowledge and computing — to create products that are built to help. It’s exciting to build these products; it’s even more exciting to see what people do with them. Thank you to everyone who helps us do this work, and most especially our Googlers. We are grateful for the opportunity. - Sundar  Editor’s note: Below is an edited transcript of Sundar Pichai's keynote address during the opening of today's Google I/O Developers Conference.

Swiatek, the world No. 1, lived up to her billing and beat Jabeur, 6-2, 7-6(5), to capture her first U.S. Open singles title. It was the third Grand Slam title of Swiatek’s brief career and her first on a surface other than clay. When Jabeur’s last forehand sailed long, Swiatek collapsed on her back after a 1 hour, 51 minute duel that got dangerously close as the afternoon wore on.", "Iga Świątek defeated Coco Gauff in the final, 6–1, 6–3 to win the women's singles tennis title at the 2022 French Open.[1] It was her second French Open title, and she dropped just one set en route, in the fourth round to Zheng Qinwen. With the win, Świątek extended her winning streak to 35 matches (dating back to the Qatar Open in February), equaling Venus Williams' tally from the 2000 season.[2] Świątek also became the youngest winner of multiple majors since Maria Sharapova in 2006.[3]  Barbora Krejčíková was the defending champion,[4] but she lost in the first round to Diane Parry. This marked only the third time in French Open history that the defending champion lost in the first round (after Anastasia Myskina in 2005 and Jeļena Ostapenko in 2018), and the record fifteenth consecutive unsuccessful French Open women's singles title defense since 2007.[5]  17-year-old Linda Nosková became the youngest qualifier to debut in the main draw since Michelle Larcher de Brito in 2009.[6][7][8][9] This was the second time in the Open Era when only one out of the top ten seeds advanced to the fourth round of a major, after 2018 Wimbledon.[10]", "Jun 10, 2023 ...

When it’s just Susie having to confront the reality that her choices have sent her into a freefall necessitating an embracement of the unethical, things get stale no matter how endearing or effective the characterizations prove. And Anne becoming non-verbal seems a missed opportunity once Susie’s prime suspect is found innocent. Only she knows her daughter is never wrong. Thus we’re left in limbo. Susie operates out of pragmatism, not malice. We can’t “enjoy” her choices as much as wince in anticipation of her inevitable comeuppance because she’s not an anti-hero. We’re not supposed to give her the benefit of the doubt. By not having Anne as a logical point of conflict, however, there’s no one else to sustainably root for.

But as both she and Jesse become more well known, she starts to find herself becoming trapped in a web of her own making. Susie Searches is a twisty, fun, and engaging film. Clemons brings relatability to a role that is, at its core, a non-heroic character. Susie's bubbliness and happy veneer put a fresh face on the type of character who wants fame so badly that they'll do anything to achieve it. Wolff brings his own brand of vulnerability to the film as Jesse, who's too pure for the world he inhabits. Other comedic actors, including Jim Gaffigan, Rachel Sennot, David Walton, and Ken Marino (who also shows off a more menacing side), also help make the film funny enough to lighten its heavy subject matter.

Everyone wants to be a hero. But what lengths might one go to get there? This is the winsome yet disturbing journey at the center of Susie Searches.  Kiersey Clemons stars as Susie Wallis, a socially awkward college student with a mind for solving mysteries. Naturally, she has her own true crime podcast called Susie Searches, so when fellow student/meditation influencer Jesse (Alex Wolff) goes missing, her interest in cracking the case isn't exactly selfless. If she finds the internet-adored victim, she and her podcast could score the validation she desperately craves. Whether she's squeezing the sheriff (Jim Gaffigan) for clues, eying a convenient creep (Ken Marino) as a suspect, or scouting out evidence, Susie is on a mission to save the day…and promote herself.  Forget the hardscrabble detectives of film noir; Susie has more in common with Oliver Putnam than she does Sam Spade. Rather than a gun and a trench coat, she carries a big smile smacked with colorful braces and a disarming demeanor that tends to make people underestimate her.

What does she really want? What are her motivations? She’s a meticulous girl and nothing, even early on before we get to the real discoveries, seem happen-chance.The color schemes and cinematography by Conor Murphy deliver an intriguing perspective as we keep Susie in our own investigative sights. Jon Natchez composes a score that accompanies the ups and downs of our protagonist’s moods ensuring that the thrilling nature of the story is pronounced.What occurs after is most enjoyed by the discovery but ends up being both light-hearted and fun, obsessive and sad. Susie isn’t a selfless character, nearly not likable on paper, but Clemons insists that she is.

However, it seems this is not the end for the famously raucous ceremony, which has kicked off awards season for the past 80 years. Here’s everything you need to know about the 2024 Golden Globe Awards, and how we ended up here. By all accounts, yes. Eldridge Industries, a holding company owned by the billionaire investor Todd Boehly, and Dick Clark Productions, which has produced the Golden Globes telecast for decades, have reportedly agreed to purchase the HFPA’s Golden Globes assets, rights, and properties for an undisclosed price. They’ll form a new non-profit, the Golden Globe Foundation, which will continue the philanthropic work of the HFPA. (The organization has given more than $50 million to entertainment-related charities over the last 30 years.) Meanwhile, a yet-to-be-named for-profit entity will also seek to expand the Golden Globes as a brand.", "Stepping away from the brink of cancellation after two years of tumult, the rebooted Golden Globes ceremony  returns to the small screen Tuesday night.

The show will take place at its usual haunt, the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills.  In September, NBC and the HFPA announced the Globes’ return to its longtime broadcast television home in time for the awards show’s 80th anniversary.   Entertainment & Arts  Every year people complain about the awards show surplus. We finally got rid of the most absurd and corrupt of them — and now the Globes are back? Why?

We have a great team in place to grow this iconic brand and captivate new and existing audiences to celebrate the very best in television and motion pictures.” The ceremony is currently scheduled for January 7, though there is not yet a broadcast partner for the awards show. It could feasibly end up on a major network or a streaming platform, as was the case for the SAG Awards, which aired live on Netflix’s  YouTube page earlier this year. On February 21, 2021, a Los Angeles Times investigation accused the HFPA of “self-dealing” and highlighted potential conflicts of interest.

The tweet of the French ministry of culture felt the same emotion, when she talked about the “crowning of an intimate work that carries the life of others” and shows a “delicate and dense writing that revolutionised literature”.    The Nobel Prize in Literature tends to be considered as the most prestigious and covered prize. Annie Ernaux now joins 16 prestigious French predecessors who received the prize before her. They include major French writers who became true leading figures of international literature of the 20th century: The French Agency for the promotion of higher education,international student services, and international mobility.", "More than a dozen French writers have captured the literature prize, though Ernaux is the first French woman to win, and just the 17th woman among the 119 Nobel literature laureates. Olsson said the academy was working to diversify its range, drawing on experts in literature from different regions and languages. “We try to broaden the concept of literature but it is the quality that counts, ultimately,” he said. Ernaux said she wasn’t sure what she would do with the Nobel’s cash award of 10 million Swedish kronor (nearly $900,000). “I have a problem with money,” she told reporters. “Money is not a goal for me. ... I don’t know how to spend it well.” A week of Nobel Prize announcements kicked off Monday with Swedish scientist Svante Paabo receiving the award in medicine for unlocking secrets of Neanderthal DNA that provided key insights into our immune system.

Quotes have been edited slightly for clarity. You can listen to the full conversation here. Ben Bernanke, distinguished senior fellow in residence with the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings, is among three winners of this year’s Nobel Prize in economic sciences. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2022 to Dr. Bernanke, Douglas Diamond, and Philip Dybvig for significantly improving our understanding of the role of banks in the economy, particularly during financial crises. On Monday, October 10, the Brookings Institution hosted a press conference to hear his thoughts on the award and discuss his research on banks and financial crises.  The simple idea that the financial system can be a driver of economic activity and unemployment was not conventional wisdom at the time. In the announcement, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences cited Bernanke’s 1983 American Economic Review paper on banking and the Great Depression. Bernanke noted that looking back on the study, although it looked “a little primitive,” it had many fruitful ideas.", "The 2022 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to the French author Annie Ernaux \"for the courage and clinical acuity with which she uncovers the roots, estrangements and collective restraints of personal memory\".[1][2] It was announced by the Swedish Academy on 6 October 2022.[3][4][5] Ernaux was the 16th French writer – the first Frenchwoman – and the 17th female author, to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature.[6][7]  Ernaux started her literary career in 1974 with Les Armoires vides (\"Cleaned Out\"), an autobiographical novel. Very early in her career, she turned away from fiction to focus on autobiography, combining historic and individual experiences. In her different viewpoints, she consistently examines a life marked by strong disparities regarding gender, language and class. Her path to authorship was long and arduous, and all her oeuvres are written in plain language. Her books are followed by a wide readership, and are reviewed in most local and national newspapers in France, as well as being the subject of many radio and television interviews and programmes, and a large and growing international academic literature.", "Ill.

However, her role as Adrianna seemingly also confirms the film will feature Isis. In the comics, Adrianna possess the Amulet of Isis, which bestows her with the powers of the goddess. It would make sense for Black Adam to show Adrianna in her superpowered form, perhaps suiting up alongside her husband for an epic battle. Of course, there are bound to be some changes in how Black Adam depicts Adrianna. For one thing, superhero movies these days are always putting some new spins on characters.

Adrianna Tomaz, DC comics’ beloved superhero embodiment of the Egyptian goddess Isis, is getting a brand new portrayal, courtesy of actress Sarah Shahi, in the upcoming Dwayne Johnson-starring Black Adam. Ahead of the much-awaited film, here’s a look at Isis’ backstory, especially in terms of her superpowers, as well as the most significant events that have shaped the character, all in accordance with the original comic books’ lore. Initially known as Adrea Thomas, prior to DC’s reintroduction of the character in the comic series 52, published in May 2006, Adrianna Tomaz, like most superheroes, was set up for an anguished backstory from the get-go. The Egyptian refugee is initially presented as a gift — alongside a hefty sum of gold— to Black Adam, Ruler of Kahndaq, by the tech-savvy organized crime syndicate, Intergang. Lionhearted in her courage, she waits until Adam has slain her captors before letting her outspoken personality shine through. She confidently presents to him her steadfastly-held opinions on how he, a dictator, should get to altering his various tyrannical ways in order to most effectively govern his own homeland!", "And I'm a much different man and actor than I was ten years ago.

Zari is eventually erased from the timeline and replaced by Zari Tarazi, an alternate version of the character played by the same actress, who is basically a socialite from the future, because Legends was a delightfully bananas show and I miss it every day. And now we have the cinematic version of the character in Black Adam: Adrianna Tomaz, a university professor and resistance fighter in Kahndaq. Obviously this is different than any version we’ve seen before, although she skews closest to the comics version. At the time of this writing, I haven’t seen the movie, so I can’t say whether Adrianna will fall in love with Adam, or get powers, or [redacted horrible things from circa 2008]. Hopefully not that last part. No matter what story Adrianna gets in the movie, she’s had an interesting journey to get there. There have certainly been missteps, like the whitewashing in the ’70s, and a whole heap of misogynistic tropes in the late 2000s.

The RTX 4090 was released on October 12. However, while Nvidia enjoys the launch of the 4090, its 30-series cards are now gaining even more popularity.
