The Hawkeyes had their destiny in their own hands, with the ball and a timeout, starting at their 25, down 20-17, with 1:48 left to win the game. And the drive started with promise. Iowa advanced to the Kentucky 40 with 48 seconds left. But then, Spencer Petras threw an errant pass into the diving arms of DeAndre Square at the Wildcats' 26. Game over. Here's how it happened. That was just a heck of a drive by Kentucky, highlighted by Wan'Dale Robinson's 52-yard catch-and-run to give him 17 catches for 170 yards so far today. Chris Rodriguez Jr. finished off the eight-play, 80-yard drive with a 6-yard rushing score. Now, can Iowa's much-maligned offense, which has performed considerably better in the second half than it did the first, win the game for this defense? Also: Tyler Linderbaum is back in the game.

Among those leading the defense is senior linebacker Micah Baskerville. He leads the team in tackles with 83, including 39 solo, with one sack for six yards.

Location also plays a role in this, as the NFL has historically preferred warm-weather locations for stadiums without a dome. SoFi Stadium has a roof, but the sides of the structure are open. As such, it is considered an open-air stadium. Below are the sites the NFL has pinned as future Super Bowl locations. The Super Bowl halftime show will feature five rap and R&B legends in 2022. Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige and Kendrick Lamar will be the performers for the spectacle. The quintet has a combined total of 43 Grammys and 21 Billboard No. 1 albums. For more information on the five performers,  click here  . The national anthem singer for 2022 will be Mickey Guyton. She recently became the first Black artist to earn a Grammy nomination for Best Country Album of the Year.  Eric Church and Jazmine Sullivan performed the anthem in 2021.", "One part of the partnership included that Roc Nation would take a big part in advising the league who they should choose for performances such as the Super Bowl Halftime Show. The 2022 Super Bowl Halftime Show will be the first for all artists aside from Blige’s appearance in 2001. Which teams are currently favorites in each conference to play in (and win) the Super Bowl next season? Weirdly, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers don’t hold the best odds of winning the Super Bowl in 2022. Their previous Super Bowl opponent has better odds, despite Tampa Bay returning all 22 starters from their Super Bowl squad. The Buccaneers are currently +600 to win it all in 2022, according to Vegas Insider. Behind the Buccaneers in the NFC are the Green Bay Packers (+1300), the San Francisco 49ers (+1400), and the Los Angeles Rams (+1400). Despite losing Super Bowl LV, the Chiefs head into 2022 as Super Bowl favorites. It’s not wild to assume they get back there, given they’ve been to the previous three conference championships and the last two Super Bowls. Their +500 odds to win the Super Bowl in 2022 are the best in the NFL. The Bills (+1000), Ravens (+1400), and Browns (+1600) are the other preseason contenders in the AFC.", "The Super Bowl is going to be held indoors for a little while. After last year's contest in Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, the Super Bowl heads out west to SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, for Super Bowl 56. From then on, the Super Bowl will continue to be held in dome stadiums for a while. Each of the next three announced venues will have a roof over the heads of the fans and players, and will be in warmer weather areas, as is typical of the Super Bowl. Sporting News has you covered with all you need to know about the location of this year's Super Bowl, as well as the host site in future years. This year's Super Bowl will be held at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, California. The home of the Rams and the Chargers, SoFi Stadium was originally set to host the Super Bowl in 2021, however its opening was delayed until 2020, and NFL rules dictate that a stadium has to be open for at least two seasons before it can host the title game. This will be the third time the city has hosted the Super Bowl, with the L.A. Memorial Coliseum having hosted it twice (1967, 1973). Pasadena also hosted the Super Bowl five times (1977, 1980, 1983, 1987, 1993) in the Rose Bowl.", "Super Bowl 56 is now the only game left in the 2022 NFL playoffs. The AFC and NFC champions have been crowned, and the Bengals will now face the Rams to determine the NFL champion for the 2021 NFL season. The 2022 NFL playoffs proved as unpredictable as the regular season. Wild-card weekend largely went as expected, but after that, chaos reigned. Both of the No. 1 seeds, the Packers and Titans, lost their first game in the divisional round, as all but one of the underdogs won outright. The lone exception was the favored Chiefs, who mounted a game-tying drive with 13 seconds left before winning in overtime. The conference championship games were wild in their own right. Both the Bengals and Rams trailed by double digits in the second half of their wins over the Chiefs and 49ers. They mounted comebacks and as a result, the Bengals will have a chance to win their first Super Bowl in franchise history in their first appearance since 1989. Meanwhile, the Rams will have a chance to avenge their loss against the Patriots in the big game just three years ago. As unpredictable as the playoffs have been, the Super Bowl broadcast, location and date are set in stone. Here's everything you need to know about the big game in 2022, including when Super Bowl 56 will be played.", "Feb 10, 2022 ... 13, 2022, at SoFi Stadium, home of the Chargers and Rams, in Los Angeles.

John Clauser, of J.F. Clauser and Associates in Walnut Creek, Calif.; Alain Aspect of the Institut d’Optique in Palaiseau, France; and Anton Zeilinger of the University of Vienna in Austria, will split a prize of 10 million Swedish kronor. Their independent works explored the foundations of quantum mechanics, the paradoxical rules that govern behavior in the subatomic world. In experiments conducted over the last 50 years, they confirmed the reality of an effect that Albert Einstein had disdained as “spooky action at a distance.” Measuring one of a widely separated pair of particles could instantaneously change the results of measuring the other particle, even if it was light-years away. Today, physicists call this strange effect quantum entanglement, and it is the basis of the burgeoning field of quantum information.

Martin. Miyazaki has said that Elden Ring will be “full of things that we weren’t able to do in the Dark Souls series.” The game will focus “more heavily on RPG elements,” Miyazaki said in an interview from 2019, and “will include a wide variety of weapons, magic, and ways to engage enemies, that make it possible to provide users with a style of gameplay and strategy that suits them.” FromSoftware fans have since been wracked with Elden Ring-information withdrawal, leading the community to fill the void with its own, self-created lore.

In the decades since, we’ve been developing our technology to deliver on that mission. The progress we've made is because of our years of investment in advanced technologies, from AI to the technical infrastructure that powers it all. And once a year — on my favorite day of the year :) — we share an update on how it’s going at Google I/O. Today, I talked about how we’re advancing two fundamental aspects of our mission — knowledge and computing — to create products that are built to help. It’s exciting to build these products; it’s even more exciting to see what people do with them. Thank you to everyone who helps us do this work, and most especially our Googlers.

During her mind-blowing 37-match win streak, the first 19 of said victories were on the surface and she earned three 1000-level hard-court titles (Qatar, Indian Wells, Miami) during that run. Swiatek reached the semifinals in Melbourne last season and is perhaps the biggest women's favorite to win a major title since Serena in her prime. Not to mention, the US Open victory gave her an extra dose of confidence about her game. \"It's a confirmation for me that [the] sky is the limit,\" she said in September. Swiatek started the 2023 season by leading the Polish team to the semifinals at the United Cup and recording straight-sets victories in her first three singles matches, including against Belinda Bencic. Although she was handed a stunning 6-2, 6-2 loss by Jessica Pegula in the semis, the normally unflappable Swiatek will likely use that as motivation in Melbourne.", "\"*\" indicates required fields Thousands have already subscribed Iga Swiatek’s 2022 campaign was the stuff of dreams. She didn’t just rise to No 1, she ran the table on tour and changed our perception of what dominance looks like on the WTA tour. Now that it’s over, we take a closer look at the stats that defined it.  Iga Swiatek’s 2022 was a thrill ride of epic proportions. The Polish juggernaut captivated the tennis world from start to finish and became the most dominant player in the game over the last 10 months, as she wrote the early chapters in what is sure to be a voluminous tome of statistics by the end of her career.  For now, as Swiatek enjoys some well-deserved rest and relaxation at home, we go inside the numbers of her mind-boggling season.  1 – Swiatek became the WTA’s 28th No.1-ranked player on April 4 (and the first Polish world No 1) and dominated from there. She produced a 41-6 record as the No 1 and has held the top ranking for 31 weeks.  2 – Number of Grand Slam titles won, Swiatek is the first player to win more than one in a single season since 2016.  3 – Number of Grand Slam titles won in 2022 by Swiatek.", "\"Obviously what happened 12 months ago was not easy for me, for my family, team, anybody who is close to me ...\" Djokovic said. \"You can't forget those events.

But it is a valuable life experience for me and something that as I said will stay there, but I have to move on.\" If Djokovic were to win, he would tie Nadal with 22 major titles, and be just one behind Serena Williams for the most in the Open era. As if there wasn't enough already on the line for him or anything. Prior to Carlos Alcaraz's withdrawal last week due to a right leg injury, it looked as if both of the reigning US Open champions would be looking for back-to-back major titles. But alas, that is not to be. But while Alcaraz won't be there, Swiatek certainly will be, and she will be attempting to cement her status as the heir apparent for tennis' superstar title.

It was seven percentage points higher than Le Pen’s result in 2017. She has had some success in moderating her image and bringing her party into the mainstream.

Still, the result was more decisive than the final polling averages that suggested Macron would win by a margin of 10 to 12 percentage points.

The use of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is what makes ChatGPT especially unique.  Through RLHF, human AI trainers provided the model with conversations in which they played both parts, the user and AI assistants, according to OpenAI.  ChatGPT is a language model created to hold a conversation with the end user. A search engine indexes web pages on the internet to help the user find the information they asked for. The free version of ChatGPT does not have the ability to search the internet for information. It uses the information it learned from training data to generate a response, which leaves room for error.  Also: ChatGPT or Google: Which gives the best answers? Another major difference is that ChatGPT only has access to information up to 2021, whereas a regular search engine like Google has access to the latest information.", "It was released on March 14, 2023, and has been made publicly available in a limited form via the chatbot product ChatGPT Plus (a premium version of ..."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

But as both she and Jesse become more well known, she starts to find herself becoming trapped in a web of her own making. Susie Searches is a twisty, fun, and engaging film. Clemons brings relatability to a role that is, at its core, a non-heroic character. Susie's bubbliness and happy veneer put a fresh face on the type of character who wants fame so badly that they'll do anything to achieve it. Wolff brings his own brand of vulnerability to the film as Jesse, who's too pure for the world he inhabits. Other comedic actors, including Jim Gaffigan, Rachel Sennot, David Walton, and Ken Marino (who also shows off a more menacing side), also help make the film funny enough to lighten its heavy subject matter. Overall, Susie Searches is a funny and entertaining feature debut for writer-director Sophie Kargman. Families can talk about the tone of Susie Searches. Is it a comedy? A drama? A mystery? All of the above? Why is Susie obsessed with becoming famous? How does she think her podcast will help her do that? Why does she take certain actions in the film? How would you describe her ethics? How does the relationship between Susie and Jesse develop? How do Susie's expectations drive her actions?", "Susie Searches is thus a quirky look at the destructive nature of popularity and the collateral damage that results when its preservation becomes more important than being “good.” I would question whether it’s able to sustain its initial enjoyment level, though—the whole is more cutely biting than uproariously funny, and such tone can prove tiring if the narrative doesn’t find a new gear to drive things forward. When it’s just Susie having to confront the reality that her choices have sent her into a freefall necessitating an embracement of the unethical, things get stale no matter how endearing or effective the characterizations prove. And Anne becoming non-verbal seems a missed opportunity once Susie’s prime suspect is found innocent. Only she knows her daughter is never wrong. Thus we’re left in limbo. Susie operates out of pragmatism, not malice. We can’t “enjoy” her choices as much as wince in anticipation of her inevitable comeuppance because she’s not an anti-hero. We’re not supposed to give her the benefit of the doubt. By not having Anne as a logical point of conflict, however, there’s no one else to sustainably root for. Maybe Loggins or Jessie’s suspicious friend Ray (Isaac Powell), but they become more red herring or potential victim than any real adversarial threat. And maybe that’s the point.", "The tonal shifts throughout were risky and may not be for everyone, but if you enjoy films that keep you guessing, this may just be for you. Leslie Combemale The co-directors chose their lead well in Kiersey Clemons, who does a great job at not telegraphing where the story is going, and allows the audience lots of choices in terms of allegiance. The camera work is almost another character, but never becomes distracting, nor does it go too over the top. There’s so a strong collaborative feeling to the performances and the way they play against each other. It’s not entirely new as a story, but adds a flavor to the mystery coming-of-age subgenre not offered in quite this way before, while centering a strong Black female lead. Jennifer Merin  Susie Searches is an enjoyably affable coming of age thriller about a teenage girl who is known for her uncanny ability to solve seemingly unsolvable crimes, and who shares the details of her her super sleuth searches and suspicions on her popular podcast. She’s also determined to further investigations by the local sheriff’s office where she is an intern. But, up close and personal, Susie is actually rather shy and, wrapped up in the coming of age issues of self esteem and teenage sexual curiosity, she hides her vulnerability behind a smile that shines through aqua-colored braces.

However, in re-imaging the conceit for a feature-length film, she and William Day Frank have smartly pivoted to build a string of reveals that keeps the macabre thrills coming. Admittedly, these jolts can make the movie feel episodic, leading me to wonder if they'd initially conceived of this as a web series or TV show. In the right headspace, this uneven ride can feel like binge-watching an addictive limited series. And, frankly, I value the rough edges when they come with such unexpected fun.  For the first act, Susie Searches runs the risk of feeling dated, presenting an amateur detective in the guileless light of literal kids stuff, like Harriet the Spy or Scooby Doo. At this point, we've been so glutted with crime shows that this tact feels tired. However, as Susie solves her mystery, the movie moves into motivations, urging the audience to reconsider their heroine, to re-examine the clues, and to question whether what we want is justice or just a good story.  Kargman and Day weave together a deceptively chipper tone with a cynical thread and an appetite for tension for a finale that is outrageous and rewarding.", "When fellow well-known and beloved student Jesse (Alex Wolff) goes missing, she’s quick on the case and when success knocks upon her door, she’s flooded with fans and fame.  There’s an element of the “search” as much as there is a degree of internal discovery as we learn more about Susie’s character. What does she really want? What are her motivations? She’s a meticulous girl and nothing, even early on before we get to the real discoveries, seem happen-chance.The color schemes and cinematography by Conor Murphy deliver an intriguing perspective as we keep Susie in our own investigative sights. Jon Natchez composes a score that accompanies the ups and downs of our protagonist’s moods ensuring that the thrilling nature of the story is pronounced.What occurs after is most enjoyed by the discovery but ends up being both light-hearted and fun, obsessive and sad. Susie isn’t a selfless character, nearly not likable on paper, but Clemons insists that she is. That strength in conviction makes Susie Searches much more, and  Clemon’s affable demeanor helps elevate it.There are also some terrific supporting comedic roles with sheriff Jim Gaffigan and Ken Marino, both are winningly charming (or disconcerting) in their own ways.  Also shoutout to Rachel Sennott as Susie’s co-worker, stealing most scenes that she is in."], "noise_rate": 1.0, "factlabel": 0}

(The WTA Tour has no such rule, which is why Djokovic’s fellow Wimbledon champion, Elena Rybakina, did not qualify for the WTA Finals in Fort Worth.) “Most of the upheaval this year is because of Djokovic,” Patrick McEnroe, a former United States Davis Cup captain and now an ESPN commentator said. “He missed two majors and didn’t get points for the one he won. It really affected the rest of the field. You could make the case that if Djokovic runs the table, wins Paris and the ATP Finals, that he deserves to be No. 1.” The player most likely to end 2022 at No. 1 is Alcaraz.

The inflation rate was up at an annualized 8.3% rate in August, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. The figure was down from the 8.5% mark recorded in July and the 9.1% inflation rate in June, which was the biggest increase in four decades.  Even as U.S. motorists have gladly watched gasoline prices fall sharply in recent weeks — down 10.6% from their peak — costs for food and apartment rentals have continued to increase.  Overall, as a result, the government said that consumer prices were up one-tenth of a percent in August, compared to July.  Food prices were up 0.8 percent in the past month, while costs for housing, medical care, new cars and household furnishings all increased in August compared to July.  Stock investors in the United States remain worried about inflation, with major indexes falling more than 2% at the opening of trading on Tuesday, an hour after the release of the inflation report.

Codenamed “Operation London Bridge,” arrangements for Britain’s longest-serving monarch have been carefully pored over for years by the many agencies involved, with the Queen herself signing off on every single detail before her death. However, these details were kept under wraps until the sitting sovereign, King Charles III, gave it all his final seal of approval.            The Queen will ultimately be laid to rest within St. George’s Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle, alongside her “strength and stay” of 73 years, Prince Philip. Here, we’ve put together a day-by-day guide on what will happen from now until the state funeral.            Following the Queen’s death, her oak coffin – draped with the Royal Standard for Scotland and a wreath of flowers – sat in the ballroom at Balmoral, where estate staff had the chance to pay their last respects.            On Sunday morning, gamekeepers carried it to a waiting hearse, and then the beloved monarch left Balmoral for the last time.

The state funeral was one of the United Kingdom's most watched special television broadcasts, surpassing the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the previous most watched royal event of the 21st century. The period of official mourning and the funeral was estimated to have cost the government £162 million.[1]  Queen Elizabeth II was in good health for most of her life; her health, however, declined significantly after the death of her husband, Prince Philip, in April 2021.[2] She began to use a walking stick for public engagements in October 2021.[3] On 20 October, the Queen stayed overnight in King Edward VII's Hospital in central London, necessitating the cancellation of scheduled visits to Northern Ireland and the COP26 summit in Glasgow.

At 4:00 p.m. (11:00 a.m. Eastern): A committal service will take place, with about 800 people attending. Guests will include members of the queen's household.

Tetsuya Yamagami was arrested immediately after allegedly shooting Abe with a handmade gun as the former leader was making a campaign speech in July outside a train station in Nara in western Japan.  Later that month, Yamagami was sent to an Osaka detention center for a nearly six-month mental evaluation, which ended Tuesday. Yamagami is now back in police custody in Nara. Prosecutors said results of his mental evaluation showed he is fit to stand trial. Yamagami was also charged with violating a gun control law, according to the Nara District Court. Police have said Yamagami told them that he killed Abe, one of Japan’s most influential and divisive politicians, because of Abe’s apparent links to a religious group that he hated. In his statements and in social media postings attributed to him, Yamagami said he developed a grudge because his mother had made massive donations to the Unification Church that bankrupted his family and ruined his life.

News of the shooting and Abe’s subsequent death horrified leaders around the world, many of whom had worked with Abe during his long tenure.           US President Joe Biden said he was “stunned, outraged, and deeply saddened,” adding he had worked closely with Abe and his killing was “a tragedy for Japan and all who knew him.”            “While there are many details that we do not yet know, we know that violent attacks are never acceptable and that gun violence always leaves a deep scar on the communities that are affected by it. The United States stands with Japan in this moment of grief,” the US president said in a statement.

DC fans will recognize the name Adrianna and associate it with Adrianna Tomaz, Black Adam's wife and the hero Isis. You can see Shahi's full post down below.

However, her role as Adrianna seemingly also confirms the film will feature Isis. In the comics, Adrianna possess the Amulet of Isis, which bestows her with the powers of the goddess.

Sadly, while it stands tall next to its RTX 4090 sibling, it’s probably not the 80-class successor you’ve been waiting for, as it flies a bit too close to the premium price point sun.   The best graphics card battlefield currently feels a bit topsy-turvy, as AMD’s top GPU, the Radeon RX 7900 XTX, is actually an RTX 4080 rival that costs $899 USD.

Nvidia’s choice to price the RTX 4090 the way it did was not the most popular decision it has ever made. After a couple of years of GPU shortage, most of us are tired of having to pay insane prices for our PC hardware. To see Nvidia not just continue that trend, but also tell its customers outright that cheaper GPUs are a thing of the past, was disheartening. Still, the RTX 4090 sold out and came back at scalper prices, with some eBay sales on launch day reaching as high as $5,000. There was a single sale for $9,999, but it’s hard to believe that this was a legitimate purchase.
