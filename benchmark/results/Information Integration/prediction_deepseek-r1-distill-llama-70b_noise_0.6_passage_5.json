Let me look through the documents provided to find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the documents for mentions of the 79th Golden Globes. The first document lists winners from what seems to be the 80th Golden Globes because it mentions \"House of the Dragon\" as the Best Television Series - Drama, which I think is from the more recent ceremony. The second document talks about the 80th Golden Globes, noting that it was the 80th time and mentioning changes after a scandal. \n\nWait, the third document has a section labeled \"Best Picture Drama: 'The Power of the Dog'\" and mentions it's from the 79th Golden Globes. That must be the one. It says \"The Power of the Dog\" won Best Picture Drama, Best Director for Jane Campion, and Best Supporting Actor for Kodi Smit-McPhee. \n\nThen, under \"Best Television Series — Musical or Comedy,\" it mentions that \"Hacks\" won, along with Jean Smart winning Best Actress.

The first document lists \"Best motion picture - drama WINNER: The Fabelmans\" and \"Best motion picture - musical or comedy WINNER: The Banshees of Inisherin.\" But that's from the 80th, I think.\n\nThe third document under the 79th Golden Globes only mentions TV categories, not motion pictures.

Maybe the document doesn't provide that info for the 79th.\n\nWait, the fourth document lists some winners but doesn't specify the year. It mentions \"Best Performance By An Actress In A Motion Picture – Musical Or Comedy\" with Rachel Zegler as the winner, but that's for acting, not the picture itself.\n\nSo, putting it together, for the 79th Golden Globes, \"The Power of the Dog\" won Best Drama Motion Picture, and \"Hacks\" won Best Musical/Comedy Television Series. But the question is about motion pictures in both categories. Since the 79th document only provides the drama winner for motion pictures, maybe the musical/comedy winner isn't listed here. Alternatively, perhaps \"West Side Story\" won in the musical/comedy category, as Rachel Zegler won for her role in it, but I'm not sure if the film itself won.\n\nWait, the fourth document also mentions \"Best Motion Picture – Animated\" as \"Encanto,\" but that's a different category. I'm not finding the Musical/Comedy motion picture winner for the 79th. Maybe the document doesn't include that information, so I can't provide the answer accurately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is referring to the 80th Golden Globes, where \"The Fabelmans\" won Drama and \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" won Musical/Comedy.

The Big Air snowboarding and freestyle skiing events were held in a former industrial area in Shijingshan District, at Western Hills area.[18] Since the end of 2009, the Beijing Olympic Village apartments on the Olympic Green had been transformed into a residential area. There was therefore a need to build another Olympic Village on a smaller scale for the Winter Olympics. These new buildings are located in the southern area of Olympic Green on the neighbourhood of the National Olympic Sports Center and will serves as Chinese Olympic Committee residential complex for those athletes who will undergo training sessions at the nearby venues.[19]"], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}
