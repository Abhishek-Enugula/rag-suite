In experiments conducted over the last 50 years, they confirmed the reality of an effect that Albert Einstein had disdained as “spooky action at a distance.” Measuring one of a widely separated pair of particles could instantaneously change the results of measuring the other particle, even if it was light-years away.

The post revealed the dates and format of the event and invited interested attendees to register for the event. The announcement was also shared on Google's social media channels.

This will be the main attraction for the general population as the main event tends to be more consumer-focused. While the event’s description doesn’t provide specifics, expect to see announcements for popular Google services, Workspace, privacy, health, and Google’s other new projects and endeavors. Also, keep an eye out for potential hardware announcements in the form of the Pixel 6a, Pixel Watch, and smart home devices.

In the decades since, we’ve been developing our technology to deliver on that mission. The progress we've made is because of our years of investment in advanced technologies, from AI to the technical infrastructure that powers it all. And once a year — on my favorite day of the year :) — we share an update on how it’s going at Google I/O. Today, I talked about how we’re advancing two fundamental aspects of our mission — knowledge and computing — to create products that are built to help. It’s exciting to build these products; it’s even more exciting to see what people do with them. Thank you to everyone who helps us do this work, and most especially our Googlers. We are grateful for the opportunity. - Sundar  Editor’s note: Below is an edited transcript of Sundar Pichai's keynote address during the opening of today's Google I/O Developers Conference.

She won 67 matches and registered a 37-match winning streak from February to July -- which became the longest undefeated stretch in women's tennis since Steffi Graf won 66 consecutive matches over 1989 and 1990. \"I felt like everything clicked this season,\" Swiatek said in a video interview with the Associated Press during her unbeaten streak. \"And I wasn't expecting to be that consistent.\" The 21-year-old from Poland was excellent on clay in 2022 but is still working to improve in grass. Her winning streak ended in the third round of Wimbledon against Alizé Cornet. Swiatek celebrated the end of the season in November with a fun video on Instagram that referenced the Lion King.", "MEN WITH 2+ TITLES IN 2022 (tour-level): 5: Djokovic [one major, ATP Finals, one 1000, one 500, one 250] 5: Alcaraz [one major, two 1000s, two 500s] 4: Nadal [two majors, one 500, one 250] 4: Auger-Aliassime [two 500s, two 250s] 4: Rublev [one 500, three 250s] 3: Fritz [one 1000, one 500, one 250] 3: Rune [one 1000, two 250s] 3: Ruud [three 250s] 2: Tsitsipas [one 1000, one 250] 2: Medvedev [one 500, one 250] 2: Berrettini [one 500, one 250] 2: Musetti [one 500, one 250] 2: Norrie [two 250s] 2: Bautista Agut [two 250s] 2: Opelka [two 250s]And there’s more—Djokovic is now tied with Jimmy Connors for most years in the Open Era winning five or more titles.", "\"Obviously what happened 12 months ago was not easy for me, for my family, team, anybody who is close to me ...\" Djokovic said. \"You can't forget those events.

But it is a valuable life experience for me and something that as I said will stay there, but I have to move on.\" If Djokovic were to win, he would tie Nadal with 22 major titles, and be just one behind Serena Williams for the most in the Open era.

Prior to Carlos Alcaraz's withdrawal last week due to a right leg injury, it looked as if both of the reigning US Open champions would be looking for back-to-back major titles. But alas, that is not to be. But while Alcaraz won't be there, Swiatek certainly will be, and she will be attempting to cement her status as the heir apparent for tennis' superstar title.

And Anne becoming non-verbal seems a missed opportunity once Susie’s prime suspect is found innocent. Only she knows her daughter is never wrong. Thus we’re left in limbo. Susie operates out of pragmatism, not malice. We can’t “enjoy” her choices as much as wince in anticipation of her inevitable comeuppance because she’s not an anti-hero.

It really affected the rest of the field. You could make the case that if Djokovic runs the table, wins Paris and the ATP Finals, that he deserves to be No. 1.” The player most likely to end 2022 at No. 1 is Alcaraz.

The fallout from his accusations led Columbia to acknowledge that it had provided misleading data, and the school did not submit new data last year. Tuesday’s announcement makes that decision permanent. In making the announcement, Columbia applauded the recent move by U.S. News to focus on the success of colleges in graduating students from different backgrounds. But Columbia also suggested that it was concerned about the inclusion of data from students in its general studies program, who tend to follow nontraditional academic paths.

The inflation rate was up at an annualized 8.3% rate in August, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. The figure was down from the 8.5% mark recorded in July and the 9.1% inflation rate in June, which was the biggest increase in four decades.  Even as U.S. motorists have gladly watched gasoline prices fall sharply in recent weeks — down 10.6% from their peak — costs for food and apartment rentals have continued to increase.  Overall, as a result, the government said that consumer prices were up one-tenth of a percent in August, compared to July.  Food prices were up 0.8 percent in the past month, while costs for housing, medical care, new cars and household furnishings all increased in August compared to July.  Stock investors in the United States remain worried about inflation, with major indexes falling more than 2% at the opening of trading on Tuesday, an hour after the release of the inflation report.

Her death was publicly announced at 18:30. She was succeeded by her eldest son, Charles III.  The death of Queen Elizabeth II set in motion Operation London Bridge, a collection of plans including arrangements for her state funeral, and supported by Operation Unicorn, which set protocols for her death occurring in Scotland. The United Kingdom observed a national mourning period of 10 days. The Queen's lying in state took place in Westminster Hall from 14 to 19 September, during which time an estimated 250,000 people queued to pay their respects.  Elizabeth's state funeral on 19 September was the first held in Britain since Winston Churchill's in 1965. A funeral service was held at Westminster Abbey, followed by a procession to Wellington Arch that featured around 3,000 military personnel and was watched by around a million people in central London. The state hearse then transported the Queen's coffin to Windsor, followed by another procession through Windsor Great Park and a committal service at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.", "Given the hours and reams of media coverage of the death of Queen Elizabeth II in recent days, it's almost surprising to learn that her funeral on Monday is still a mystery to millions in the USA.  Nevertheless, the gods of Google insist multiple questions are trending about the funeral.

That procession, led by King Charles III and his siblings, will look very much like the procession to take the coffin from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Hall on Wednesday, but shorter. The royals will be accompanied by ranks of uniformed troops, senior palace officials and even the queen's pages as hundreds of thousands of mourners line the streets of central London to pay respects.", "The Queen was interred with her husband, Prince Philip, in the King George VI Memorial Chapel later that evening, in a private service attended only by her closest family.  The state funeral was the largest security operation ever mounted in the UK, and included dignitaries from around the world. The funeral was designated as a public holiday in the UK and several Commonwealth states. The state funeral was one of the United Kingdom's most watched special television broadcasts, surpassing the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the previous most watched royal event of the 21st century. The period of official mourning and the funeral was estimated to have cost the government £162 million.[1]  Queen Elizabeth II was in good health for most of her life; her health, however, declined significantly after the death of her husband, Prince Philip, in April 2021.[2] She began to use a walking stick for public engagements in October 2021.[3] On 20 October, the Queen stayed overnight in King Edward VII's Hospital in central London, necessitating the cancellation of scheduled visits to Northern Ireland and the COP26 summit in Glasgow.

Tetsuya Yamagami was arrested immediately after allegedly shooting Abe with a homemade gun as the former leader was making a campaign speech in July outside a train station in Nara in western Japan. He then underwent a nearly six-month mental evaluation, which prosecutors said showed he is fit to stand trial. Yamagami was also charged with violating a gun control law, according to the Nara District Court.  Police have said Yamagami told them that he killed Abe, one of Japan’s most influential and divisive politicians, because of Abe’s apparent links to a religious group that he hated. In his statements and in social media postings attributed to him, Yamagami said he developed a grudge because his mother had made massive donations to the Unification Church that bankrupted his family and ruined his life. One of his lawyers, Masaaki Furukawa, told The Associated Press on Thursday that Yamagami will have to take responsibility for the serious consequences of his alleged actions and that his defense lawyers will do their best to reduce his sentence.  Japanese law allows capital punishment for murder, but experts say the death penalty usually is handed down for multiple killings and Yamagami could get life in prison if convicted.", "96] Five vehicles carrying various old professional acquaintances of Abe's, including former defence minister Tomomi Inada, took part in the motorcade conveying Abe's body back to his home in Tokyo.

She shared her appreciation at getting the chance to play this role, and even revealed the name of her character. \"Very proud to represent my fellow middle eastern brothers and sisters as Adrianna,\" Shahi wrote. DC fans will recognize the name Adrianna and associate it with Adrianna Tomaz, Black Adam's wife and the hero Isis. You can see Shahi's full post down below. Adrianna has long been rumored to be a part of Black Adam, so it isn't too surprising that Shahi is actually playing her. However, her role as Adrianna seemingly also confirms the film will feature Isis. In the comics, Adrianna possess the Amulet of Isis, which bestows her with the powers of the goddess. It would make sense for Black Adam to show Adrianna in her superpowered form, perhaps suiting up alongside her husband for an epic battle. Of course, there are bound to be some changes in how Black Adam depicts Adrianna. For one thing, superhero movies these days are always putting some new spins on characters. For another, Shahi's initial casting described her character as \"a university professor and freedom fighter leading the resistance in Kahndaq.", "Over the years, she's had supporting roles in Person of Interest, Chicago Fire, and City on a Hill. Shahi will be seen as Adrianna Tomaz, aka Isis, in the widely anticipated DC film Black Adam. One of the film's most fascinating aspects is Black Adam's relationship with Adrianna Tomaz. Regarding her role in the film, Sarah Shahi said during an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Adrianna Tomaz has a brother named Karim, played by actor Mohammed Amer. Not many other plot details are known at this point, but it'll be interesting to see how Adrianna Tomaz's role as Black Adam's love interest pans out in the film. Black Adam chronicles the eventful story of the titular character who returns to the modern world after centuries of imprisonment and teams up with the Justice Society of America (JSA). Here's the official synopsis of the movie, as per DC: The film's initial reactions have been mostly positive, with praise majorly directed towards the thrilling action sequences and ambitious plot. Dwayne Johnson has received high praise from fans for his performance in the lead role. Black Adam will drop in theaters on Friday, October 21, 2022.", "She also does not go by “Isis,” because by then the militant organization ISIS was too prominent for anyone to be comfortable with the name; given the different name, powers, history, and lack of codename, I suspect even a lot of comics fans never connected her to the character in the comics. Zari is eventually erased from the timeline and replaced by Zari Tarazi, an alternate version of the character played by the same actress, who is basically a socialite from the future, because Legends was a delightfully bananas show and I miss it every day. And now we have the cinematic version of the character in Black Adam: Adrianna Tomaz, a university professor and resistance fighter in Kahndaq. Obviously this is different than any version we’ve seen before, although she skews closest to the comics version. At the time of this writing, I haven’t seen the movie, so I can’t say whether Adrianna will fall in love with Adam, or get powers, or [redacted horrible things from circa 2008]. Hopefully not that last part. No matter what story Adrianna gets in the movie, she’s had an interesting journey to get there.
