The AFC and NFC champions have been crowned, and the Bengals will now face the Rams to determine the NFL champion for the 2021 NFL season. The 2022 NFL playoffs proved as unpredictable as the regular season. Wild-card weekend largely went as expected, but after that, chaos reigned. Both of the No. 1 seeds, the Packers and Titans, lost their first game in the divisional round, as all but one of the underdogs won outright. The lone exception was the favored Chiefs, who mounted a game-tying drive with 13 seconds left before winning in overtime. The conference championship games were wild in their own right. Both the Bengals and Rams trailed by double digits in the second half of their wins over the Chiefs and 49ers. They mounted comebacks and as a result, the Bengals will have a chance to win their first Super Bowl in franchise history in their first appearance since 1989. Meanwhile, the Rams will have a chance to avenge their loss against the Patriots in the big game just three years ago. As unpredictable as the playoffs have been, the Super Bowl broadcast, location and date are set in stone.

Which teams are currently favorites in each conference to play in (and win) the Super Bowl next season? Weirdly, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers don’t hold the best odds of winning the Super Bowl in 2022. Their previous Super Bowl opponent has better odds, despite Tampa Bay returning all 22 starters from their Super Bowl squad. The Buccaneers are currently +600 to win it all in 2022, according to Vegas Insider. Behind the Buccaneers in the NFC are the Green Bay Packers (+1300), the San Francisco 49ers (+1400), and the Los Angeles Rams (+1400). Despite losing Super Bowl LV, the Chiefs head into 2022 as Super Bowl favorites. It’s not wild to assume they get back there, given they’ve been to the previous three conference championships and the last two Super Bowls. Their +500 odds to win the Super Bowl in 2022 are the best in the NFL.

The NFL officially announced that Las Vegas would host the 2024 Super Bowl. Allegiant Stadium, the new home of the Raiders, will host Super Bowl 58, which is no surprise given that the NFL prioritizes hosting the Super Bowl at stadiums with recently updated and upgraded amenities. Location also plays a role in this, as the NFL has historically preferred warm-weather locations for stadiums without a dome. SoFi Stadium has a roof, but the sides of the structure are open. As such, it is considered an open-air stadium. Below are the sites the NFL has pinned as future Super Bowl locations. The Super Bowl halftime show will feature five rap and R&B legends in 2022. Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige and Kendrick Lamar will be the performers for the spectacle.
