Codenamed “Operation London Bridge,” arrangements for Britain’s longest-serving monarch have been carefully pored over for years by the many agencies involved, with the Queen herself signing off on every single detail before her death. However, these details were kept under wraps until the sitting sovereign, King Charles III, gave it all his final seal of approval.            The Queen will ultimately be laid to rest within St. George’s Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle, alongside her “strength and stay” of 73 years, Prince Philip. Here, we’ve put together a day-by-day guide on what will happen from now until the state funeral.            Following the Queen’s death, her oak coffin – draped with the Royal Standard for Scotland and a wreath of flowers – sat in the ballroom at Balmoral, where estate staff had the chance to pay their last respects.            On Sunday morning, gamekeepers carried it to a waiting hearse, and then the beloved monarch left Balmoral for the last time. The first leg of the Queen’s final journey saw the royal cortege make a six-hour journey to Edinburgh and the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the official residence of the British monarch in Scotland.", "Sep 19, 2022 ... Queen Elizabeth II's coffin was lowered into the royal crypt at St. George's ... to Westminster Abbey, where her funeral will take place.", "The Queen was interred with her husband, Prince Philip, in the King George VI Memorial Chapel later that evening, in a private service attended only by her closest family.  The state funeral was the largest security operation ever mounted in the UK, and included dignitaries from around the world. The funeral was designated as a public holiday in the UK and several Commonwealth states. The state funeral was one of the United Kingdom's most watched special television broadcasts, surpassing the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the previous most watched royal event of the 21st century. The period of official mourning and the funeral was estimated to have cost the government £162 million.[1]  Queen Elizabeth II was in good health for most of her life; her health, however, declined significantly after the death of her husband, Prince Philip, in April 2021.[2] She began to use a walking stick for public engagements in October 2021.[3] On 20 October, the Queen stayed overnight in King Edward VII's Hospital in central London, necessitating the cancellation of scheduled visits to Northern Ireland and the COP26 summit in Glasgow. She suffered a sprained back in November, which prevented her from attending the 2021 National Service of Remembrance.[4][5][6][7]  In February 2022, during the COVID-19 pandemic in England, the Queen was one of several people at Windsor Castle to test positive for COVID-19.", "In 1947, at the age of 21, then-Princess Elizabeth married Prince Philip at Westminster Abbey's altar. Five years later, her coronation was held here.  Family joy would follow with the marriage of her grandson Prince William to Kate Middleton here in 2011. Family sorrow would come, too, with the funeral of the queen's mother in 2002, and then the funeral of her husband in 2021. The last time a monarch's funeral was held in Westminster Abbey itself was 262 years ago, for King George II. \"This is Westminster Abbey. This is her majesty the queen. I think you can assume that you're going to see tradition in action — great, living tradition in action,\" said the Very Reverend Dr. David Hoyle, who was appointed by the queen as the 39th Dean of Westminster Abbey, and who is tasked with leading the service.  \"I think the job of the abbey and the job of people like me, to some extent, is to keep stitching the story together — to say it's possible in pretty divided and volatile times to say, all this can be gathered in, reconciled, redeemed, celebrated.

To revist this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. By Radhika Seth On June 12, 2023, after enduring years of controversy, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the organization that founded the Golden Globes, announced that it would be closing. However, it seems this is not the end for the famously raucous ceremony, which has kicked off awards season for the past 80 years. Here’s everything you need to know about the 2024 Golden Globe Awards, and how we ended up here. By all accounts, yes. Eldridge Industries, a holding company owned by the billionaire investor Todd Boehly, and Dick Clark Productions, which has produced the Golden Globes telecast for decades, have reportedly agreed to purchase the HFPA’s Golden Globes assets, rights, and properties for an undisclosed price. They’ll form a new non-profit, the Golden Globe Foundation, which will continue the philanthropic work of the HFPA. (The organization has given more than $50 million to entertainment-related charities over the last 30 years.) Meanwhile, a yet-to-be-named for-profit entity will also seek to expand the Golden Globes as a brand.", "Planning and producing the Golden Globes ceremony annually will remain a focus, too. Earlier this year, the HFPA disclosed that the voting body for the 2024 competition will be comprised of 310 journalists from outside the US, a group which will include the organization’s 95 current members. In a statement, Dick Clark Productions’s CEO Jay Penske said: “As stewards of the Golden Globe Awards, our mission is to continue creating the most dynamic awards ceremony on live television viewed across the world. We have a great team in place to grow this iconic brand and captivate new and existing audiences to celebrate the very best in television and motion pictures.” The ceremony is currently scheduled for January 7, though there is not yet a broadcast partner for the awards show. It could feasibly end up on a major network or a streaming platform, as was the case for the SAG Awards, which aired live on Netflix’s  YouTube page earlier this year. On February 21, 2021, a Los Angeles Times investigation accused the HFPA of “self-dealing” and highlighted potential conflicts of interest. Among them was the fact that 30 HFPA members had been flown to France to visit the set of Emily in Paris in 2019. Two years later, the series was nominated for two Golden Globes, while more critically lauded shows like I May Destroy You were snubbed.", "From Top Gun: Maverick and Elvis to Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, the movie categories boasted a wide-ranging group of nominees. Colin Farrell‘s The Banshees of Inisherin earned the highest number of nods with a total of eight — the most by any single film since 2004’s Cold Mountain.

Now that the organization has outlined its plans for reform, publicists and agents say that some stars are open to participating, while others want the Globes to be permanently retired. Based on this year’s list of presenters — which include Billy Porter, Natasha Lyonne and Quentin Tarantino — many are planning to show up on Tuesday. Wait, aren’t awards shows usually on Sunday? Typically, but this one was bumped to avoid clashing with NBC’s “Sunday Night Football.” Held at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, Calif., the telecast will air at 8 p.m. Eastern time, 5 p.m. Pacific time on NBC. For the first time, the show will also be available simultaneously online, through NBCUniversal’s streaming service, Peacock. The comedian Jerrod Carmichael will be the master of ceremonies.

Abe died from excessive bleeding and was pronounced dead at 5:03 p.m. local time, doctors at the Nara Medical University hospital said during a news conference on Friday. The doctors said the bullet that killed the former Japanese leader was “deep enough to reach his heart” and a team of 20 medical professionals were unable to stop the bleeding.           Abe went into cardiopulmonary arrest at the site of the shooting and was rushed to hospital in a state of cardiac arrest at 12:20 p.m. local time, doctors said. During surgery, doctors discovered a gunshot wound to his neck and a large wound on his heart.

News of the shooting and Abe’s subsequent death horrified leaders around the world, many of whom had worked with Abe during his long tenure.           US President Joe Biden said he was “stunned, outraged, and deeply saddened,” adding he had worked closely with Abe and his killing was “a tragedy for Japan and all who knew him.”            “While there are many details that we do not yet know, we know that violent attacks are never acceptable and that gun violence always leaves a deep scar on the communities that are affected by it.

Who was former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe?", "(Kyodo News via AP)       TOKYO (AP) — Japanese prosecutors formally charged the suspect in the assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe with murder, sending him to stand trial, a court said Friday. Tetsuya Yamagami was arrested immediately after allegedly shooting Abe with a homemade gun as the former leader was making a campaign speech in July outside a train station in Nara in western Japan. He then underwent a nearly six-month mental evaluation, which prosecutors said showed he is fit to stand trial. Yamagami was also charged with violating a gun control law, according to the Nara District Court.  Police have said Yamagami told them that he killed Abe, one of Japan’s most influential and divisive politicians, because of Abe’s apparent links to a religious group that he hated. In his statements and in social media postings attributed to him, Yamagami said he developed a grudge because his mother had made massive donations to the Unification Church that bankrupted his family and ruined his life. One of his lawyers, Masaaki Furukawa, told The Associated Press on Thursday that Yamagami will have to take responsibility for the serious consequences of his alleged actions and that his defense lawyers will do their best to reduce his sentence.  Japanese law allows capital punishment for murder, but experts say the death penalty usually is handed down for multiple killings and Yamagami could get life in prison if convicted.", "Abe was assassinated Friday on a street in western Japan by a gunman who opened fire on him from behind as he delivered a campaign speech - an attack that stunned the nation with some of the strictest gun control laws anywhere.

At your service.            2022 was the year the Streaming Wars broke. The era of huge budgets and endless hubris came to an end as the rent came due all at once. In spring and summer, Netflix, the leader in the space, hemorrhaged users for the first time in ten years, prompting a stock swoon, a swath of layoffs, and a moratorium on the blank checks the company used to dole out to Hollywood needle movers. (Sorry, Bright 2, we hardly knew you.) Plenty of analysts have tried to evaluate exactly what went wrong, and most lay the blame on a combination of a middling slate of original programming and a newfound national stinginess in the face of rising inflation. Thankfully, Netflix has humbled itself to address at least one of those issues with a new payment plan it put into action this autumn. For a teensy $6.99 per month, anyone can pay for a Netflix subscription … as long as they’re willing to sit through a few commercials during playback. The plan is called Basic With Ads, and the $6.99 figure is much more aligned with consumer expectations compared with the bloated premium $20 subscription — which I discovered I was still somehow paying for over the course of reporting this story.

Following news that Robbie won't be the only star to play Barbie, Mackey revealed to Empire in July 2022 that outside of filming, the cast gathered for a slumber party. And it was a Barbie-only party for the actors who play the famed doll figure.  'Right in the beginning, we had a sleepover for the Barbies,' Mackey told the news outlet. Referring to co-stars Evans and Gatwa, she added that it 'would involve playing games with Scott and Ncuti'.  Sharing details about the cast's fun moments away from set, Mackey admitted: 'I don't play games usually, because I get so competitive and angry. But Scott and I were top of the game.'

I think ultimately it is a conversation we’re having about ourselves, but it’s easy to put it on Barbie.” Robbie along with her Ken, Ryan Gosling, and I were speaking in Beverly Hills a few weeks before the film opens on July 21, a date that has turned into a gender battle at the box office between “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan’s three-hour historical drama about the making of the atomic bomb, “Oppenheimer.” That hasn’t stopped Robbie and Gosling from vibrating with excitement over what they’ve created and the deep understanding their writer-director Greta Gerwig had for the material. (Gerwig co-wrote the script with her partner, Noah Baumbach.) Gosling compared her work to Warhol’s Campbell’s soup can: “It’s like showing you this thing that you’ve seen a million times as art,” he said. “Once I read the script, I felt like I was seeing all these things that were around me in a completely new and deep and hilarious way.” Gerwig in an email likened her stars to “top-flight race cars just hanging out and sometimes racing, but just for fun,” and added “I think they were both just delighted by the other.” In our conversation Robbie and Gosling spoke about Friday-night script readings with Mattel executives, how Ken is regarded in the Gosling household and leaning in to the thorny aspects of Barbie.

It was uninspiring.” Speculation about Robbie’s casting as Barbie first began in 2015, after a Sony email leak reportedly revealed that she was among the actresses potentially being considered to play the famous doll. Years later, in October 2018, The Hollywood Reporter revealed that Robbie was in talks to star in and produce the film with Warner Bros.  She also wasn’t the only star attached to the film. In 2016, Amy Schumer had reportedly landed the role but dropped out a few months later due to scheduling conflicts, according to THR. In 2017, Anne Hathaway was  reported to possibly star.  Greta Gerwig has been attached to the Barbie flick since 2019, when she was confirmed to write the script with Noah Baumbach.

This rule was possibly made to prevent nominations of live-action films that rely heavily on motion capture, such as Avatar (2009).[citation needed]  At the 94th Academy Awards in 2022, the award for the Best Animated Feature was presented by three actresses who portrayed as Disney princess characters in live-action remakes of their respective animated films: Lily James (Cinderella), Naomi Scott (Aladdin), and Halle Bailey (The Little Mermaid).

The makers of that fine-enough 2019 franchise-starter, including director David F. Sandberg, toned down both the Troma Lite cynicism and post-Spielberg sentimentality that’s come to define the lighthearted James Gunn-style super-projects that dominate the landscape. “Shazam! Fury of the Gods” meanders further in that direction. The first “Shazam!” works as well as it does because it’s mostly focused on two adolescent pipsqueaks, Billy Batson (Asher Angel) and Freddy Freeman (Jack Dylan Grazer), who get sucked into a generic fantasy, with some assistance from their extended family of orphan buddies. “Shazam! Fury of the Gods” mostly sticks to the comic book formula that the first movie poked fun at, despite another strong comedic performance from star Zachary Levi and some sporadic yuks throughout.

But Andrew explained how to walk the llamas and we began our hike. Right away, I noticed that my son’s llama was more responsive and much calmer than mine. My llama was less experienced. He was making sounds and being obnoxious. He wasn't responding to me. Andrew took over and taught me to be a little more forceful. He told me to adjust to my llama’s personality.  As we continued to walk, my son’s llama suddenly became distraught and began making a scary sound.

Image creation is one of the more intriguing applications for this technology, and Google’s efforts in this area materialized as Imagen, a text-based image generation tool much like Midjourney and DALL-E 2. Now, Google is sharing research showcasing Imagen Editor, where textual prompts and a little sketching can suffice to perform local edits on photos. Google’s Imagen utility is already adept at creating images from scratch, solely off of textual prompts. However, if you aren’t satisfied with the result, you’re usually forced to restructure your prompt, polish it, and give the image generator another go, simply because Imagen doesn’t yet allow editing specific elements of images you aren’t happy with. To address this, Google recently shared research for Imagen Editor and EditBench, utilities currently in beta, but capable of guiding edits with text prompts. Instead of creating fresh images using a prompt, Imagen Editor needs a photo that must be edited, a text prompt from the user defining the change, and a masked region defining where the edit needs to be applied.

Despite this, the studio’s work is widely cited as a major influence on dozens of other titles such as “Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order,” “God of War” and “The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.” Many gamers and critics have asked FromSoftware to add difficulty settings to its games; the studio has steadfastly refused so far. FromSoftware’s award-winning creative director Hidetaka Miyazaki has said the uniformly intense challenge in his games is meant to provide players with a sense of accomplishment. This polarizing design philosophy has won FromSoftware a devoted following — but also a small cadre of detractors who have described the company’s games as alienating. That perception changed with “Elden Ring.” FromSoftware’s most recent title, made in collaboration with “A Game of Thrones” writer George R.R.

Critics and fans praised FromSoftware’s approach in “Elden Ring,” which made the game more accessible than the studio’s previous titles with a wider array of playstyle options.

Today, its Model 3 is the world’s best-selling electric vehicle, surpassing the milestone threshold of 1 million cars sold in June of 2021. The world is changing. It is a fast-moving place where we can no longer ignore acronyms. There is no need to LOL, IMHO. We just have to keep up ASAP.  Keeping with the theme of tech, one big event that drew the attention of many eyes this past week was Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Sept. 7 unveiling of its newest products. The introduction of the latest array of iPhones, Apple Watches and Air Pods always has some sort of impact on the company’s stock. Apple stock was bolstered about 0.9% on the news of the event, and ended the day last Wednesday up 0.5%.

The Louisiana-based satellite company, it was announced, has entered into a partnership with Apple to provide users of the iPhone 14 Pro with emergency services via direct-to-satellite communications. The iPhone 14 Pro is equipped with an antenna that will give users the ability to connect to satellite frequencies to use a text-based service to communicate their location in case of emergency in areas without cell service. The announcement resulted in Globalstar stock soaring last Wednesday, hitting a high on the day of $2.28. It, however, quickly retraced from that high, hitting a low the following day of $1.66. It closed the week on Friday at $1.77. Globalstar Weekly Chart Source: Investing.com The initial roller coaster effect was based purely on a knee-jerk reaction to the announcement by Apple. The stock's failure to launch in any sustainable upward movement, however, is more a reflection of reality.

You have successfully joined our subscriber list. iIn this guide, we will focus on the MATANA group that is expected to make headlines in the coming years, according to analysts. To refer to certain sets of technology stocks that lead the stock market, analysts and investors often use terms like FANG, FAANG, MAANG, MATANA, and more. Investing in these stock groups can have multiple benefits, such as diversification, compensating for any losses that one of the companies may experience, as well as exposure to growing sectors. Many of these companies focus on rapidly growing sectors, such as artificial intelligence (IA), which has become the technological trend of 2023 following the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Furthermore, by hosting the most popular technology companies, these groups have great liquidity, making it very easy to buy or sell their stocks, and providing greater flexibility for investors to invest in other companies. And obviously, the companies included in these groups have historical success in markets. For example, FANG is composed of four renowned technology companies: Facebook Inc – its name was changed to META Platforms Inc (NYSE: META), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Google LLC (NASDAQ: GOOGL).", "It’s highly unlikely that this herd of bulls has the long-term forecast wrong.  There’s a big jump down to the MATANA stock with the next best upside, and that’s Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The Street’s $292 target implies 13% upside, slightly ahead of Apple’s projected gain. Microsoft’s run from here may be limited because the stock has already bounced 20% off its November 2022 low. Microsoft's rally has come at the hands of two major catalysts. First, better-than-expected December quarter earnings suggested an inflection point is near regarding sluggish Windows, Office and Azure spending. For the current quarter, analysts anticipate 11% bottom-line growth, which would be the highest in five quarters.  Second, the company’s aggressive push into conversational AI has demonstrated leadership in this emerging technology. Microsoft recently announced that its Edge and Bing browsers would come with AI chat functionality similar to ChatGPT in which it has invested $10 billion.  Based on the sharp year-to-date advance (and technical indicators such as MACD), Microsoft could probably have a better entry point. If the stock revisits the $230 level, this would be a more favorable entry — especially considering $220 has proven to be reliable support.

The stores sell various Apple products, including Mac personal computers, iPhone smartphones, iPad tablet computers, Apple Watch smartwatches, Apple TV digital media players, software, and both Apple-branded and selected third-party accessories.  The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs, after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts. Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship with consumers and hired Ron Johnson in 2000. Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997 and opened the first two physical stores in 2001. The media initially speculated that Apple would fail, but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so. Apple has expanded the number of retail locations and its geographical coverage over the years, with 526 stores across 26 countries and regions worldwide, opening its latest store in the Battersea district of London, United Kingdom on June 15, 2023.[2][3] Strong product sales have placed Apple among the top-tier retail stores, with sales over $16 billion globally in 2011.", "A few days after that, he is set to unlock the doors on the New Delhi store, in a high-end mall in the Saket neighborhood. That store’s barricades lifted on Tuesday. The two stores have been a long time in the making as India’s strict rules forbid global brands from opening own-brand outlets unless they source a significant portion of the goods from within the country. Apple didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment on Cook’s visit. The company opened its Indian online store in 2020. The country is the world’s second-largest smartphone market and among the fastest-growing, but Apple’s relatively high sticker prices are still a deterrent in the nation of 1.4 billion where affordability plays a major role in purchase decisions. In between the two store inaugurals, Apple has sought a meeting for Cook with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said one of the people. Modi’s government has been pushing for electronics manufacturing and has offered billions of dollars in incentives to attract Apple’s manufacturing partners like Foxconn Technology Group and Pegatron Corp. On Apple earnings calls, Cook has stressed India’s importance as a market and production base. During the latest such conference, Cook said Apple set “a quarterly revenue record and grew very strong double digits year over year” in the country. “India is a hugely exciting market for us and a major focus,” Cook said on the call. “I’m very bullish on India.” --With assistance from Mark Gurman.", "Apr 10, 2023 ...

The two stores - in capital Delhi and India's financial hub Mumbai - will be inaugurated later this month. Bloomberg has reported that Apple chief Tim Cook is likely to visit India next week for the occasion. The unique, colourful design of the Mumbai store - inspired by the black-and-yellow taxis that zip through the city - and hype around the launch have stirred excitement in many Indians. The iPhone is still an aspirational product in the price-sensitive Indian market - more than 95% of smartphones run on Google's Android platform.  Until now, Indians could buy Apple products in the country either online or through a vast network of what the company calls \"premium resellers\". So there has been some speculation about whether the ability to sell products directly to customers in India - the world's second largest smartphone market - will impact its fortunes here. It also comes at a time when India is rising fast as a manufacturing base for the iPhone.  But some experts say that even though the new stores will be important branding tools, they would have little impact on Apple's market share in India.  \"The whole idea of opening an Apple store is to showcase the range of products available in the Apple ecosystem.", "Mr Roy says that Apple's decision to open physical stores in India could be the next step in its branding strategy. \"It's not as if this will change Apple sales in any dramatic way,\" he adds, \"but it is still a key milestone, one that will allow Apple to deliver to Indian customers the full Apple experience\". Spacious, carefully curated and full of artful displays and clever designs, these stores are projected as the physical embodiment of the Apple brand itself. \"The excitement to visit these stores is an experience of its own,\" Mr Roy says.  He adds that setting up an Apple store in India is also a statement that the country is \"now big enough for Apple to be actually interested in expanding operations here\" in more than one way.  Apple first began making a lower-end model of the iPhone in India in 2017 in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Last year it began producing its latest model of iPhone 14 in the country, which now accounts for 5% of total iPhone production.  For years, Apple had relied on China's sophisticated manufacturing network to produce the bulk of its products. But its dependence on the country was strained after Beijing announced its \"zero-Covid\" policy, leading to months of industrial lockouts and massive supply chain disruptions. \"India's Holy Grail would be to get a big iconic brand like Apple to move from China to India.

A Ski Federation official massaged her back with an American flag until she felt well enough to stand, then helped her away from the finish line. “It's really emotional,” Diggins said after the race. “That's one of the hardest things I've ever done in my whole life, especially because I had food poisoning 30 hours ago, which is why I thought I was going to die at the finish line.” She said she’d spent most of the previous day in bed, but managed to get down enough food to rally for Sunday’s race.", "February 13, 2022: Growing up in sunny Florida and being accustomed to inline skating, U.S. speedskater Erin Jackson didn't try ice skating until 2017.
