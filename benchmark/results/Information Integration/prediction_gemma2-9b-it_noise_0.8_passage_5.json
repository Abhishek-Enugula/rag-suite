Both of the No. 1 seeds, the Packers and Titans, lost their first game in the divisional round, as all but one of the underdogs won outright. The lone exception was the favored Chiefs, who mounted a game-tying drive with 13 seconds left before winning in overtime. The conference championship games were wild in their own right. Both the Bengals and Rams trailed by double digits in the second half of their wins over the Chiefs and 49ers. They mounted comebacks and as a result, the Bengals will have a chance to win their first Super Bowl in franchise history in their first appearance since 1989. Meanwhile, the Rams will have a chance to avenge their loss against the Patriots in the big game just three years ago.

Location also plays a role in this, as the NFL has historically preferred warm-weather locations for stadiums without a dome. SoFi Stadium has a roof, but the sides of the structure are open. As such, it is considered an open-air stadium. Below are the sites the NFL has pinned as future Super Bowl locations.

In the decades since, we’ve been developing our technology to deliver on that mission. The progress we've made is because of our years of investment in advanced technologies, from AI to the technical infrastructure that powers it all. And once a year — on my favorite day of the year :) — we share an update on how it’s going at Google I/O. Today, I talked about how we’re advancing two fundamental aspects of our mission — knowledge and computing — to create products that are built to help. It’s exciting to build these products; it’s even more exciting to see what people do with them. Thank you to everyone who helps us do this work, and most especially our Googlers. We are grateful for the opportunity. - Sundar  Editor’s note: Below is an edited transcript of Sundar Pichai's keynote address during the opening of today's Google I/O Developers Conference.

With the win, Świątek extended her winning streak to 35 matches (dating back to the Qatar Open in February), equaling Venus Williams' tally from the 2000 season.[2] Świątek also became the youngest winner of multiple majors since Maria Sharapova in 2006.[3]  Barbora Krejčíková was the defending champion,[4] but she lost in the first round to Diane Parry. This marked only the third time in French Open history that the defending champion lost in the first round (after Anastasia Myskina in 2005 and Jeļena Ostapenko in 2018), and the record fifteenth consecutive unsuccessful French Open women's singles title defense since 2007.[5]  17-year-old Linda Nosková became the youngest qualifier to debut in the main draw since Michelle Larcher de Brito in 2009.[6][7][8][9] This was the second time in the Open Era when only one out of the top ten seeds advanced to the fourth round of a major, after 2018 Wimbledon.[10]", "Gauff, an 18-year-old from Delray Beach, Florida, was disappointed after the loss, but talked about how this match -- and her run to the final -- has helped boost her confidence. \"For a while I really believed I couldn't do it just because ever since I was 15 and I first came on people had so much expectations for me and I started to believe that I couldn't do it and you know I made a final and I wasn't expecting it and I know that I'll get this opportunity again and I hope that I can come out on top next time. The numbers tell the story of a dominant and composed match for Swiatek -- which was the story of her tournament and could be the tag line for her last three months of tennis. 73% first serves in, 72% win rate on first serves, 5-for-10 in break point chances, just 16 unforced errors. On the other side of the court Gauff struggled on her first serve, winning just 46% of her first serve points and coming away with three double faults and 23 unforced errors and 21 forced errors.

So I just wanted to take it step by step. I didn’t have any exact goals on this tournament. Just seeing how my game is developing every match, it’s something that’s giving me a lot of hope, and I’m just proud of myself.” Caira Conner profiled Coco Gauff, a young athlete looking way beyond the end of her racquet.

At the other end of the age spectrum, Rafael Nadal became the oldest player to become French Open champion in 2022, turning 36 two days before the men's final on June 5. Andres Gimeno had previously been the oldest French Open champion, winning in 1972 at the age of 34 years and 10 months.

The Golden Boot provides a consolation for the young Frenchman but, understandably, he was less than impressed to be forced into posing with the trophy. His hat-trick in the final — the first since 1966 — brought his 2022 World Cup tally to eight goals, one more than club team-mate Messi. Mbappe now has 12 goals at World Cup finals, leaving him just four behind the all-time leading goalscorer Miroslav Klose. It feels like 2026, with its expanded format, will be the year that he smashes that record to pieces. For now, the 23-year-old won’t be particularly excited by picking up one of football’s great individual accolades but a Golden Boot should never be sniffed at. While Messi will forever be the hero of the 2022 World Cup final, he has his goalkeeper to thank once again for winning trophies on the international stage.

What does she really want? What are her motivations? She’s a meticulous girl and nothing, even early on before we get to the real discoveries, seem happen-chance.The color schemes and cinematography by Conor Murphy deliver an intriguing perspective as we keep Susie in our own investigative sights. Jon Natchez composes a score that accompanies the ups and downs of our protagonist’s moods ensuring that the thrilling nature of the story is pronounced.What occurs after is most enjoyed by the discovery but ends up being both light-hearted and fun, obsessive and sad. Susie isn’t a selfless character, nearly not likable on paper, but Clemons insists that she is.

However, in re-imaging the conceit for a feature-length film, she and William Day Frank have smartly pivoted to build a string of reveals that keeps the macabre thrills coming. Admittedly, these jolts can make the movie feel episodic, leading me to wonder if they'd initially conceived of this as a web series or TV show. In the right headspace, this uneven ride can feel like binge-watching an addictive limited series. And, frankly, I value the rough edges when they come with such unexpected fun.  For the first act, Susie Searches runs the risk of feeling dated, presenting an amateur detective in the guileless light of literal kids stuff, like Harriet the Spy or Scooby Doo. At this point, we've been so glutted with crime shows that this tact feels tired. However, as Susie solves her mystery, the movie moves into motivations, urging the audience to reconsider their heroine, to re-examine the clues, and to question whether what we want is justice or just a good story.

From its opening, with careful admiration on the smooth blue fabric, there’s a richness invoked, one that remains for the film’s entirety. It’s a film about traditions, relationships, and the vibrant colors of the connections we create.At first glance, it seems like Mina (whose illness- though not specified, has her in a decline throughout the film) and Halim’s marriage is strained and distant. But, after a closer look, the marriage at The Blue Craftan‘s center is more resilient. Halim hides his sexuality from his wife and the world, frequenting bathhouses for anonymous sex, while Mina is distrustful of the new apprentice they’ve hired, the young Youssef (Ayoub Messioui) noticing the attraction between Halim and him.", "Susie Searches is thus a quirky look at the destructive nature of popularity and the collateral damage that results when its preservation becomes more important than being “good.” I would question whether it’s able to sustain its initial enjoyment level, though—the whole is more cutely biting than uproariously funny, and such tone can prove tiring if the narrative doesn’t find a new gear to drive things forward. When it’s just Susie having to confront the reality that her choices have sent her into a freefall necessitating an embracement of the unethical, things get stale no matter how endearing or effective the characterizations prove. And Anne becoming non-verbal seems a missed opportunity once Susie’s prime suspect is found innocent. Only she knows her daughter is never wrong. Thus we’re left in limbo. Susie operates out of pragmatism, not malice. We can’t “enjoy” her choices as much as wince in anticipation of her inevitable comeuppance because she’s not an anti-hero. We’re not supposed to give her the benefit of the doubt. By not having Anne as a logical point of conflict, however, there’s no one else to sustainably root for. Maybe Loggins or Jessie’s suspicious friend Ray (Isaac Powell), but they become more red herring or potential victim than any real adversarial threat.

By Radhika Seth On June 12, 2023, after enduring years of controversy, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the organization that founded the Golden Globes, announced that it would be closing. However, it seems this is not the end for the famously raucous ceremony, which has kicked off awards season for the past 80 years. Here’s everything you need to know about the 2024 Golden Globe Awards, and how we ended up here. By all accounts, yes. Eldridge Industries, a holding company owned by the billionaire investor Todd Boehly, and Dick Clark Productions, which has produced the Golden Globes telecast for decades, have reportedly agreed to purchase the HFPA’s Golden Globes assets, rights, and properties for an undisclosed price. They’ll form a new non-profit, the Golden Globe Foundation, which will continue the philanthropic work of the HFPA. (The organization has given more than $50 million to entertainment-related charities over the last 30 years.) Meanwhile, a yet-to-be-named for-profit entity will also seek to expand the Golden Globes as a brand.", "Planning and producing the Golden Globes ceremony annually will remain a focus, too. Earlier this year, the HFPA disclosed that the voting body for the 2024 competition will be comprised of 310 journalists from outside the US, a group which will include the organization’s 95 current members. In a statement, Dick Clark Productions’s CEO Jay Penske said: “As stewards of the Golden Globe Awards, our mission is to continue creating the most dynamic awards ceremony on live television viewed across the world. We have a great team in place to grow this iconic brand and captivate new and existing audiences to celebrate the very best in television and motion pictures.” The ceremony is currently scheduled for January 7, though there is not yet a broadcast partner for the awards show. It could feasibly end up on a major network or a streaming platform, as was the case for the SAG Awards, which aired live on Netflix’s  YouTube page earlier this year. On February 21, 2021, a Los Angeles Times investigation accused the HFPA of “self-dealing” and highlighted potential conflicts of interest. Among them was the fact that 30 HFPA members had been flown to France to visit the set of Emily in Paris in 2019. Two years later, the series was nominated for two Golden Globes, while more critically lauded shows like I May Destroy You were snubbed.", "Appearing recently on NBC’s “Tonight Show,” Carmichael took aim at the network as well as the awards show, and said it was his idea — along with NBC’s “lazy and pushy” marketing team — to brand the ceremony as an “evening of joy and devastation.”  Awards  The best looks from the 2023 Golden Globes, including Ana de Armas, Viola Davis and Jenna Ortega.   Announcing the nominees last month, the HFPA recognized the films “The Banshees of Inisherin” and “Everything Everywhere All at Once” and TV series “Abbott Elementary” and “The White Lotus,” among others. Below are the projects that have been tapped in the major categories, taken from the complete list of 2023 nominees: Best motion picture — drama Best motion picture — musical or comedy Television series — drama Television series — musical or comedy  Awards  The Globes return to TV this year after a hiatus sparked by a Times investigation into the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. Here are the nominees.   Given Hollywood’s aloof response to the nominations, it’s almost surprising how many stars have agreed to come out for the glittery affair. The HFPA has announced a substantial list of presenters, many of whom are nominated, ramping up the star power for the telecast.  Meanwhile, actor and comedian Eddie Murphy will be given the 2023 Cecil B.", "And more than 100 Hollywood publicity firms called on the association to “eradicate the longstanding exclusionary ethos and pervasive practice of discriminatory behavior, unprofessionalism, ethical impropriety and alleged financial corruption.” Until the group made its plans for change public, the firms said, they would not advise their clients to engage with the group’s journalists. Now that the organization has outlined its plans for reform, publicists and agents say that some stars are open to participating, while others want the Globes to be permanently retired. Based on this year’s list of presenters — which include Billy Porter, Natasha Lyonne and Quentin Tarantino — many are planning to show up on Tuesday. Wait, aren’t awards shows usually on Sunday? Typically, but this one was bumped to avoid clashing with NBC’s “Sunday Night Football.” Held at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, Calif., the telecast will air at 8 p.m. Eastern time, 5 p.m. Pacific time on NBC. For the first time, the show will also be available simultaneously online, through NBCUniversal’s streaming service, Peacock. The comedian Jerrod Carmichael will be the master of ceremonies.

Tetsuya Yamagami was arrested immediately after allegedly shooting Abe with a homemade gun as the former leader was making a campaign speech in July outside a train station in Nara in western Japan. He then underwent a nearly six-month mental evaluation, which prosecutors said showed he is fit to stand trial. Yamagami was also charged with violating a gun control law, according to the Nara District Court.  Police have said Yamagami told them that he killed Abe, one of Japan’s most influential and divisive politicians, because of Abe’s apparent links to a religious group that he hated. In his statements and in social media postings attributed to him, Yamagami said he developed a grudge because his mother had made massive donations to the Unification Church that bankrupted his family and ruined his life. One of his lawyers, Masaaki Furukawa, told The Associated Press on Thursday that Yamagami will have to take responsibility for the serious consequences of his alleged actions and that his defense lawyers will do their best to reduce his sentence.  Japanese law allows capital punishment for murder, but experts say the death penalty usually is handed down for multiple killings and Yamagami could get life in prison if convicted.", "Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida paid his “deepest condolences” to former leader Abe, saying he “was a personal friend, with whom (he) spent a lot of time.”           Kishida said he had a “great respect for the legacy (Abe) left behind” and would continue election campaigning on Saturday, adding a free and fair election must be defended at all costs.           News of the shooting and Abe’s subsequent death horrified leaders around the world, many of whom had worked with Abe during his long tenure.           US President Joe Biden said he was “stunned, outraged, and deeply saddened,” adding he had worked closely with Abe and his killing was “a tragedy for Japan and all who knew him.”            “While there are many details that we do not yet know, we know that violent attacks are never acceptable and that gun violence always leaves a deep scar on the communities that are affected by it. The United States stands with Japan in this moment of grief,” the US president said in a statement.            Later on Friday, Biden ordered American flags at the White House and on other federal grounds be flown at half-staff until Sunday in recognition of Abe’s death.

Zari is eventually erased from the timeline and replaced by Zari Tarazi, an alternate version of the character played by the same actress, who is basically a socialite from the future, because Legends was a delightfully bananas show and I miss it every day. And now we have the cinematic version of the character in Black Adam: Adrianna Tomaz, a university professor and resistance fighter in Kahndaq.

DC fans will recognize the name Adrianna and associate it with Adrianna Tomaz, Black Adam's wife and the hero Isis. You can see Shahi's full post down below. Adrianna has long been rumored to be a part of Black Adam, so it isn't too surprising that Shahi is actually playing her. However, her role as Adrianna seemingly also confirms the film will feature Isis. In the comics, Adrianna possess the Amulet of Isis, which bestows her with the powers of the goddess. It would make sense for Black Adam to show Adrianna in her superpowered form, perhaps suiting up alongside her husband for an epic battle. Of course, there are bound to be some changes in how Black Adam depicts Adrianna. For one thing, superhero movies these days are always putting some new spins on characters.

The company unveiled the GeForce RTX 4090 and GeForce RTX 4080 today at its GTC 2022 keynote. Taking full advantage of its new \"Ada Lovelace\" architecture, NVIDIA says the two GPUs offer significantly better ray tracing performance. The company worked with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to co-develop a new \"4N\" fabrication process that NVIDIA says is up to two times more power efficient than the 8nm process it used for its 30 Series cards.  Ray tracing performance is significantly improved thanks to Ada Lovelace featuring NVIDIA's new third-generation RT Cores, and the inclusion of a new rendering technique called Shader Execution Reordering and DLSS 3.0. In some games, NVIDIA said you can expect two to three times better ray tracing performance than what was possible with its Ampere GPUs. The company demoed Cyberpunk 2077 running at a near consistent 100 frames per second with all of the game's ray tracing features set to max.

Nvidia’s choice to price the RTX 4090 the way it did was not the most popular decision it has ever made.
