The first document lists some winners, like Rachel Zegler for West Side Story and Andrew Garfield for Tick, Tick…Boom! under the Musical/Comedy categories.

It also mentions the 79th where \"The Power of the Dog\" won Best Drama and \"Hacks\" won Best Television Musical/Comedy.\n\nWait, but the question is about the film categories, not television. So for the 79th, the film Best Drama was \"The Power of the Dog\" and Best Musical/Comedy film wasn't mentioned in the first document, but in the second and third, under the 79th, it's not explicitly stated.

The second document clearly mentions the 79th Golden Globes with \"The Power of the Dog\" winning Best Drama and \"Hacks\" winning Best TV Comedy. However, \"Hacks\" is a TV show, not a film. \n\nWait, so for the 79th Golden Globes, the Best Motion Picture – Drama was \"The Power of the Dog,\" and the Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy was \"Don’t Look Up\"? Or was it another film? Let me check the second document again. It says that at the 79th, \"The Power of the Dog\" won Best Picture Drama, and \"Hacks\" won Best TV Comedy. But for films, the Musical/Comedy winner isn't mentioned in the documents provided. \n\nWait, the first document lists the winners for the 79th, but under the film categories, it stops at Supporting Actress. It doesn't include the Best Picture categories. The second document mentions the 79th's Best Picture Drama as \"The Power of the Dog\" but doesn't specify the Musical/Comedy film winner. The third document talks about the 80th, where \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" won Musical/Comedy and \"The Fabelmans\" won Drama. \n\nSo, based on the provided documents, the 79th Golden Globes' Best Drama was \"The Power of the Dog.\" However, the Best Musical or Comedy film isn't mentioned in the documents. The user is asking about both categories for the 79th.

It only shows up to the Supporting Actress. So, perhaps the documents don't include the Best Picture Musical/Comedy winner for the 79th.

Each of the next three announced venues will have a roof over the heads of the fans and players, and will be in warmer weather areas, as is typical of the Super Bowl. Sporting News has you covered with all you need to know about the location of this year's Super Bowl, as well as the host site in future years. This year's Super Bowl will be held at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, California. The home of the Rams and the Chargers, SoFi Stadium was originally set to host the Super Bowl in 2021, however its opening was delayed until 2020, and NFL rules dictate that a stadium has to be open for at least two seasons before it can host the title game. This will be the third time the city has hosted the Super Bowl, with the L.A. Memorial Coliseum having hosted it twice (1967, 1973). Pasadena also hosted the Super Bowl five times (1977, 1980, 1983, 1987, 1993) in the Rose Bowl.", "Because New Orleans was supposed to host it, but a conflict with Mardi Gras forced them to push hosting back to 2025.

Allegiant Stadium, the new home of the Raiders, will host Super Bowl 58, which is no surprise given that the NFL prioritizes hosting the Super Bowl at stadiums with recently updated and upgraded amenities. Location also plays a role in this, as the NFL has historically preferred warm-weather locations for stadiums without a dome. SoFi Stadium has a roof, but the sides of the structure are open. As such, it is considered an open-air stadium. Below are the sites the NFL has pinned as future Super Bowl locations. The Super Bowl halftime show will feature five rap and R&B legends in 2022. Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige and Kendrick Lamar will be the performers for the spectacle. The quintet has a combined total of 43 Grammys and 21 Billboard No. 1 albums. For more information on the five performers,  click here  . The national anthem singer for 2022 will be Mickey Guyton.

Their previous Super Bowl opponent has better odds, despite Tampa Bay returning all 22 starters from their Super Bowl squad. The Buccaneers are currently +600 to win it all in 2022, according to Vegas Insider. Behind the Buccaneers in the NFC are the Green Bay Packers (+1300), the San Francisco 49ers (+1400), and the Los Angeles Rams (+1400). Despite losing Super Bowl LV, the Chiefs head into 2022 as Super Bowl favorites. It’s not wild to assume they get back there, given they’ve been to the previous three conference championships and the last two Super Bowls.

Both of the No. 1 seeds, the Packers and Titans, lost their first game in the divisional round, as all but one of the underdogs won outright. The lone exception was the favored Chiefs, who mounted a game-tying drive with 13 seconds left before winning in overtime. The conference championship games were wild in their own right. Both the Bengals and Rams trailed by double digits in the second half of their wins over the Chiefs and 49ers. They mounted comebacks and as a result, the Bengals will have a chance to win their first Super Bowl in franchise history in their first appearance since 1989.

I remember that the Nobel Prizes are awarded every year in various fields, and they're a big deal. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll start by recalling any information I have about the 2022 Nobel Prizes. I think I heard something about quantum mechanics being involved in the Physics prize. Maybe some scientists working on entangled photons or something like that? I'm not entirely sure about the names, though. I think one of them might be John Clauser because I remember that name from somewhere.\n\nNow, for the Chemistry prize, I'm pretty sure it was about click chemistry. I remember reading that three scientists won it for their work in that area. Click chemistry is a concept where molecules can be joined together quickly and efficiently under mild conditions, right? I think one of the winners was Carolyn Bertozzi. She's a woman, so that stands out. The other names I'm not too sure about, but maybe Barry Sharpless? I think he's won a Nobel Prize before, maybe even twice. That would make sense because I remember hearing about someone winning two Nobels, which is rare.\n\nWait, let me try to piece this together. For Physics, the Nobel Prize was awarded to three scientists for their work on quantum mechanics, specifically experiments with entangled photons and violating Bell inequalities. The names I think are Alain Aspect, John F. Clauser, and Anton Zeilinger. That sounds right because I remember seeing those names mentioned together in the context of quantum mechanics research.\n\nFor Chemistry, as I thought earlier, it was about click chemistry and bioorthogonal chemistry. The three winners were Carolyn R. Bertozzi, Morten Meldal, and K. Barry Sharpless. I'm pretty confident about Bertozzi and Sharpless, and Meldal sounds familiar too. Sharpless won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry twice, which is a unique achievement.\n\nI should double-check to make sure I'm not mixing up any names or categories. I think the Physics prize was definitely for quantum mechanics work, and the Chemistry was for click chemistry. So, putting it all together:\n\nPhysics: Alain Aspect, John F. Clauser, Anton Zeilinger.\n\nChemistry: Carolyn R. Bertozzi, Morten Meldal, K. Barry Sharpless.\n\nI don't think I'm confusing any of these with other years because I remember the click chemistry prize being in 2022, and the quantum mechanics work was also that year.

The 2022 physics laureates’ development of experimental tools has laid the foundation for a new era of quantum technology. Being able to manipulate and manage quantum states and all their layers of properties gives us access to tools with unexpected potential.  Intense research and development are underway to utilise the special properties of individual particle systems to construct quantum computers, improve measurements, build quantum networks and establish secure quantum encrypted communication. This year’s Nobel Prize laureate John Clauser built an apparatus that emitted two entangled photons at a time, each towards a filter that tested their polarisation. The result was a clear violation of a Bell inequality and agreed with the predictions of quantum mechanics.", "The Nobel committee said in a statement that “click chemistry and bioorthogonal reactions have taken chemistry into the era of functionalism,” adding that “this is bringing the greatest benefit to humankind.” Among her many awards, Bertozzi is a recipient of the 2014 Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award, the Department of Energy’s highest scientific honor. She was named a MacArthur Fellow in 1999. She won the Wolf Prize in Chemistry in 2022. Bertozzi completed her undergraduate degree in chemistry at Harvard University and her Ph.D. at UC Berkeley.

The news arrives roughly a year after the debut of the game. You'll play as the \"Tarnished,\" a mysterious character who returns from exile to redeem (or further destroy!) a hellish, rotting world. Many a gamer will tell you that Elden Ring is one of the most difficult games they've ever played, forcing you to spend literal days of your time just to get the muscle to survive the first few bosses.

It was directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki with worldbuilding provided by fantasy writer George R. R. Martin. It was released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on February 25 by FromSoftware in Japan and Bandai Namco Entertainment internationally. Players control a customizable player character who is on a quest to repair the Elden Ring and become the new Elden Lord.  Elden Ring is presented through a third-person perspective; players freely roam its interactive open world. The six main areas are traversed using the player character's steed Torrent as the primary mode of travel. Linear, hidden dungeons can be explored to find useful items. Players can use several types of weapons and magic spells, including non-direct engagement enabled by stealth mechanics. Throughout the game's world, checkpoints enable fast travel and allow players to improve their attributes using an in-game currency called Runes. Elden Ring has an online multiplayer mode in which players can join each other for cooperative and player-versus-player combat.  During planning, FromSoftware wanted to create an open-world game with gameplay similar to Dark Souls; the company wanted Elden Ring to act as an evolution of the self-titled debut of the series. Miyazaki admired the work of Martin, whose contributions he hoped would produce a more accessible narrative than those of the company's earlier games.", "Elden Ring was pitched at that year’s E3 as FromSoftware’s “largest game to-date,” and is said to be set in a “sprawling realm steeped in a rich and bloody history” crafted by Dark Souls creator Hidetaka Miyazaki and Game of Thrones creator George R.R. Martin. Miyazaki has said that Elden Ring will be “full of things that we weren’t able to do in the Dark Souls series.” The game will focus “more heavily on RPG elements,” Miyazaki said in an interview from 2019, and “will include a wide variety of weapons, magic, and ways to engage enemies, that make it possible to provide users with a style of gameplay and strategy that suits them.” FromSoftware fans have since been wracked with Elden Ring-information withdrawal, leading the community to fill the void with its own, self-created lore.

Elden Ring has practically become a meme during its much-awaited journey from edit suite to shelves. Between an initial reveal at E3 2019 and E3 2021, precious little had been shown about the game, save for some key art and the promise it’d be made in collaboration with Game of Thrones‘ George R. R. Martin. It wasn’t exactly a lot to go on. But finally, it’s almost here. Developer FromSoftware (known for the Dark Souls series, Bloodborne and Sekiro) and publisher Bandai Namco, who have kept shtum over few years, have increasingly been teasing more and more about the game ahead of its imminent release. “With Elden Ring, we have applied all our dark fantasy and action-RPG expertise cultivated throughout the Dark Souls series, in order to create a bold, classical evolution of the genre,” commented Hidetaka Miyazaki, director at FromSoftware. “We’ve crafted a rich world with a staggering sense of scale, based off of legends written for the game by George R. R. Martin. Elden Ring is a world full of mystery and peril, ready to be explored and discovered; a drama in which various characters flaunt their own mystique and ulterior motives.

Each section lists details like the year introduced, capacity, colors, model numbers, and some specs. \n\nIn the section about the iPhone 14, it mentions that in the United States, there's no SIM tray, but in other countries, there's a SIM tray on the left side holding a nano-SIM card. The display is a 6.1-inch all-screen Super Retina XDR display. The back is glass with a flat-edged anodized aluminum band. There are two cameras on the back: Ultra Wide and Main. It also mentions the A16 Bionic chip under the 'Splash, Water, and dust resistant' section, but wait, that might be under the iPhone 14 Pro section. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, the A16 Bionic chip is mentioned under the iPhone 14 Pro details. The document says the iPhone 14 Pro has the A16 Bionic chip, while the iPhone 14 has a different chip. Then there's another part of the document that talks about the chips in more detail.\n\nFurther down, there's a section that discusses the chips in the iPhone 14 lineup. It says that the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Max won't get an upgraded chip this year. Apple typically updates the chip every year, like the A14 in iPhone 12 and A15 in iPhone 13. But for iPhone 14, it's different. The document mentions that the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro will have the same A15 chip as the previous year, but the Pro models might have an upgraded version. Wait, no, actually, it says that the iPhone 14 and 14 Max won't get an upgrade, implying they might have the same chip as the iPhone 13, which was the A15. But then it also says that the Pro models might have a different chip. \n\nWait, no, the document says that the iPhone 14 lineup will have different chips. The iPhone 14 and 14 Max won't get an upgrade, so they probably have the A15 chip, while the Pro models have the A16 chip. That makes sense because the document mentions the A16 Bionic chip in the iPhone 14 Pro section.\n\nSo, putting it together, the iPhone 14 has the A15 Bionic chip, and the iPhone 14 Pro has the A16 Bionic chip. This aligns with what the document states, where the Pro model gets the upgraded chip, while the standard models stick with the previous year's chip.\n</think>\n\nThe iPhone 14 models feature different chips: the iPhone 14 is equipped with the A15 Bionic chip, while the iPhone 14 Pro has the A16 Bionic chip.", "docs": ["In other countries or regions, there's a SIM tray on the left side that holds a \"fourth form factor\" (4FF) nano-SIM card.

To land the French title, Gauff must beat a player on a 34-match winning streak, going for a sixth title in succession, and therefore upset the odds, though she has yet to drop a set this year in Paris.

So I just wanted to take it step by step. I didn’t have any exact goals on this tournament. Just seeing how my game is developing every match, it’s something that’s giving me a lot of hope, and I’m just proud of myself.” Caira Conner profiled Coco Gauff, a young athlete looking way beyond the end of her racquet.  She is among a burgeoning cohort of athletes who use time in front of reporters to speak up on issues that have little to do with the racquets or balls in their hands.", "Gauff, an 18-year-old from Delray Beach, Florida, was disappointed after the loss, but talked about how this match -- and her run to the final -- has helped boost her confidence. \"For a while I really believed I couldn't do it just because ever since I was 15 and I first came on people had so much expectations for me and I started to believe that I couldn't do it and you know I made a final and I wasn't expecting it and I know that I'll get this opportunity again and I hope that I can come out on top next time.

On the other side of the court Gauff struggled on her first serve, winning just 46% of her first serve points and coming away with three double faults and 23 unforced errors and 21 forced errors.

The use of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is what makes ChatGPT especially unique.  Through RLHF, human AI trainers provided the model with conversations in which they played both parts, the user and AI assistants, according to OpenAI.  ChatGPT is a language model created to hold a conversation with the end user. A search engine indexes web pages on the internet to help the user find the information they asked for. The free version of ChatGPT does not have the ability to search the internet for information. It uses the information it learned from training data to generate a response, which leaves room for error.  Also: ChatGPT or Google: Which gives the best answers?

OpenAI also recommends that users of GPT-4 establish protocols that match the needs of the user’s specific application of GPT-4 (such as “human review, grounding with additional context, or avoiding high-stakes uses altogether”).[18] As President and Co-Founder of OpenAI Greg Brockman said during the March 14, 2023 developer demo live stream, GPT-4 works best when used in tandem with people who check its work—it is “an amplifying tool” that when used together with humans allows us to “reach new heights,” but it “is not perfect” and neither are humans.

I've been a fan of Ken and Jim forever. I got very lucky with this cast. Rachel Sennott is astounding. I've been a fan of Rachel's since Shiva Baby. Sophie Kargman: I can't speak enough about this cast without mentioning Meredith Tucker, our extraordinary casting director. Meredith cast White Lotus and Eighth Grade. We were very much in step the whole way through. This was an interesting role for Ken. Has the actor ever played a character like this? If yes, then they probably won't say yes. If no, that's exciting. You want your actors to be like, \"This is exciting. I've never done this before.\" That's why I went after them. They have this unbelievable pastiche of wonderful work, but nothing quite like this. That's why I'm hoping that this would resonate and it did.

However, in re-imaging the conceit for a feature-length film, she and William Day Frank have smartly pivoted to build a string of reveals that keeps the macabre thrills coming. Admittedly, these jolts can make the movie feel episodic, leading me to wonder if they'd initially conceived of this as a web series or TV show. In the right headspace, this uneven ride can feel like binge-watching an addictive limited series. And, frankly, I value the rough edges when they come with such unexpected fun.  For the first act, Susie Searches runs the risk of feeling dated, presenting an amateur detective in the guileless light of literal kids stuff, like Harriet the Spy or Scooby Doo. At this point, we've been so glutted with crime shows that this tact feels tired. However, as Susie solves her mystery, the movie moves into motivations, urging the audience to reconsider their heroine, to re-examine the clues, and to question whether what we want is justice or just a good story.  Kargman and Day weave together a deceptively chipper tone with a cynical thread and an appetite for tension for a finale that is outrageous and rewarding.", "When fellow well-known and beloved student Jesse (Alex Wolff) goes missing, she’s quick on the case and when success knocks upon her door, she’s flooded with fans and fame.  There’s an element of the “search” as much as there is a degree of internal discovery as we learn more about Susie’s character. What does she really want? What are her motivations? She’s a meticulous girl and nothing, even early on before we get to the real discoveries, seem happen-chance.The color schemes and cinematography by Conor Murphy deliver an intriguing perspective as we keep Susie in our own investigative sights. Jon Natchez composes a score that accompanies the ups and downs of our protagonist’s moods ensuring that the thrilling nature of the story is pronounced.What occurs after is most enjoyed by the discovery but ends up being both light-hearted and fun, obsessive and sad. Susie isn’t a selfless character, nearly not likable on paper, but Clemons insists that she is. That strength in conviction makes Susie Searches much more, and  Clemon’s affable demeanor helps elevate it.There are also some terrific supporting comedic roles with sheriff Jim Gaffigan and Ken Marino, both are winningly charming (or disconcerting) in their own ways.  Also shoutout to Rachel Sennott as Susie’s co-worker, stealing most scenes that she is in.", "Susie Searches is thus a quirky look at the destructive nature of popularity and the collateral damage that results when its preservation becomes more important than being “good.” I would question whether it’s able to sustain its initial enjoyment level, though—the whole is more cutely biting than uproariously funny, and such tone can prove tiring if the narrative doesn’t find a new gear to drive things forward. When it’s just Susie having to confront the reality that her choices have sent her into a freefall necessitating an embracement of the unethical, things get stale no matter how endearing or effective the characterizations prove. And Anne becoming non-verbal seems a missed opportunity once Susie’s prime suspect is found innocent. Only she knows her daughter is never wrong. Thus we’re left in limbo. Susie operates out of pragmatism, not malice. We can’t “enjoy” her choices as much as wince in anticipation of her inevitable comeuppance because she’s not an anti-hero. We’re not supposed to give her the benefit of the doubt. By not having Anne as a logical point of conflict, however, there’s no one else to sustainably root for. Maybe Loggins or Jessie’s suspicious friend Ray (Isaac Powell), but they become more red herring or potential victim than any real adversarial threat. And maybe that’s the point.", "The tonal shifts throughout were risky and may not be for everyone, but if you enjoy films that keep you guessing, this may just be for you. Leslie Combemale The co-directors chose their lead well in Kiersey Clemons, who does a great job at not telegraphing where the story is going, and allows the audience lots of choices in terms of allegiance. The camera work is almost another character, but never becomes distracting, nor does it go too over the top. There’s so a strong collaborative feeling to the performances and the way they play against each other. It’s not entirely new as a story, but adds a flavor to the mystery coming-of-age subgenre not offered in quite this way before, while centering a strong Black female lead. Jennifer Merin  Susie Searches is an enjoyably affable coming of age thriller about a teenage girl who is known for her uncanny ability to solve seemingly unsolvable crimes, and who shares the details of her her super sleuth searches and suspicions on her popular podcast. She’s also determined to further investigations by the local sheriff’s office where she is an intern. But, up close and personal, Susie is actually rather shy and, wrapped up in the coming of age issues of self esteem and teenage sexual curiosity, she hides her vulnerability behind a smile that shines through aqua-colored braces.

This may explain the delay of response from Abe's bodyguards after the first round of gunshot.[77]  Paramedics arrived on the scene at 11:37 am, and an ambulance later arrived at 11:41 am.[78] Six out of the twenty-four emergency responders at the scene later showed signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the Nara City Fire Department.[78]  Police sources told NHK that Abe was initially conscious and responsive after being shot.[79] A doctor who arrived at the scene said there were no signs indicating Abe was conscious.[80] Shortly thereafter, he was transported to a local hospital by emergency helicopter with a wound to the right side of his neck and internal bleeding under his left chest, arriving approximately fifty minutes after being shot.[81] He was reported to have no vital signs when he arrived at Nara Medical University Hospital in Kashihara, likely due to cardiopulmonary arrest prior to his arrival.", "82][3][83] At 2:45 pm, a press conference was held by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who stated that Abe was in critical condition and that \"doctors [were] doing everything they [could]\".[84]  Abe's wife Akie arrived at the hospital at 4:55 pm.[85] Despite doctors' efforts, Abe was pronounced dead at the hospital at 5:03 pm, around five and a half hours after being shot.[6][86][87] He was 67 years old. Hidetada Fukushima, a doctor at the hospital, said the cause of Abe's death was blood loss, despite four hours of blood transfusions that saw the administration of 100 units of blood.[b][89][90] Fukushima said that Abe was hit by two bullets[91] and that one bullet was not found in Abe's body.[92] The police autopsy concluded Abe died from loss of blood after a bullet damaged an artery under his collarbone.[93]  Several hours after the assassination, both former prime minister Yoshihide Suga[94] and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno visited the hospital where Abe's body was being held.[95]  The body was subject to a judicial autopsy and departed from the hospital with Abe's widow at 5:55 a.m. on 9 July.", "Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida paid his “deepest condolences” to former leader Abe, saying he “was a personal friend, with whom (he) spent a lot of time.”           Kishida said he had a “great respect for the legacy (Abe) left behind” and would continue election campaigning on Saturday, adding a free and fair election must be defended at all costs.           News of the shooting and Abe’s subsequent death horrified leaders around the world, many of whom had worked with Abe during his long tenure.           US President Joe Biden said he was “stunned, outraged, and deeply saddened,” adding he had worked closely with Abe and his killing was “a tragedy for Japan and all who knew him.”            “While there are many details that we do not yet know, we know that violent attacks are never acceptable and that gun violence always leaves a deep scar on the communities that are affected by it. The United States stands with Japan in this moment of grief,” the US president said in a statement.            Later on Friday, Biden ordered American flags at the White House and on other federal grounds be flown at half-staff until Sunday in recognition of Abe’s death.      Who was former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe?", "(Kyodo News via AP)       TOKYO (AP) — Japanese prosecutors formally charged the suspect in the assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe with murder, sending him to stand trial, a court said Friday. Tetsuya Yamagami was arrested immediately after allegedly shooting Abe with a homemade gun as the former leader was making a campaign speech in July outside a train station in Nara in western Japan. He then underwent a nearly six-month mental evaluation, which prosecutors said showed he is fit to stand trial. Yamagami was also charged with violating a gun control law, according to the Nara District Court.  Police have said Yamagami told them that he killed Abe, one of Japan’s most influential and divisive politicians, because of Abe’s apparent links to a religious group that he hated. In his statements and in social media postings attributed to him, Yamagami said he developed a grudge because his mother had made massive donations to the Unification Church that bankrupted his family and ruined his life. One of his lawyers, Masaaki Furukawa, told The Associated Press on Thursday that Yamagami will have to take responsibility for the serious consequences of his alleged actions and that his defense lawyers will do their best to reduce his sentence.  Japanese law allows capital punishment for murder, but experts say the death penalty usually is handed down for multiple killings and Yamagami could get life in prison if convicted."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

Right now, the film's plot is still being kept under wraps, so everything is speculation. Still, come next year, audiences just might meet the goddess Isis on the big screen.", "Whether because of the often complex rights issues surrounding the Shazam franchise or the fact that demon-possessed supervillains can be a tough sell in all-ages superhero fare, Sabbac hasn't appeared much outside of DC's comic book line. The character receives a mention (along with Ibac) in an episode of the animated series Young Justice. Sabbac's second host, Ishmael Gregor, appears as a recurring villain in Arrow: Season 5, but strictly in his role as a gangster from Oliver Queen's checkered past.  Sabbac will finally make his proper, live-action debut in the Black Adam movie, with Aladdin's Marwan Kenzari cast as Ishmael Gregor. Thanks to a leaked McFarlane Toys action figure, we know this version of Gregor is depicted as the leader of Intergang, one of the dominant criminal organizations in the DCU. But whereas Intergang is normally known for harnessing advanced weaponry and tech against heroes like Superman, it seems Gregor is turning to the supernatural realm in his fight against Black Adam and the Justice Society.   It's pretty clear already that the DCEU version of Sabbac isn't a particularly close adaptation of any of the comic book incarnations. He may instead draw elements from all three. Like Timothy Karnes, this version of Gregor may turn out to be a member of a family with centuries-old ties to Sabbac.", "She also does not go by “Isis,” because by then the militant organization ISIS was too prominent for anyone to be comfortable with the name; given the different name, powers, history, and lack of codename, I suspect even a lot of comics fans never connected her to the character in the comics. Zari is eventually erased from the timeline and replaced by Zari Tarazi, an alternate version of the character played by the same actress, who is basically a socialite from the future, because Legends was a delightfully bananas show and I miss it every day. And now we have the cinematic version of the character in Black Adam: Adrianna Tomaz, a university professor and resistance fighter in Kahndaq. Obviously this is different than any version we’ve seen before, although she skews closest to the comics version. At the time of this writing, I haven’t seen the movie, so I can’t say whether Adrianna will fall in love with Adam, or get powers, or [redacted horrible things from circa 2008]. Hopefully not that last part. No matter what story Adrianna gets in the movie, she’s had an interesting journey to get there. There have certainly been missteps, like the whitewashing in the ’70s, and a whole heap of misogynistic tropes in the late 2000s. But she’s still an important figure in superhero history who rarely gets her due.", "Black Adam star Sarah Shahi explained the relationship between her character Adrianna Tomaz and Black Adam.  Black Adam is a new DCEU movie starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson in the title role, coming exclusively to theaters on October 21, 2022. The Rock is joined by an all-star cast, including Sarah Shahi, Aldis Hodge, Pierce Brosnan, Viola Davis and more.  Sarah Shahi plays Adrianna Tomaz in Black Adam, a character who becomes the super-powered antihero “Isis” in the world of DC comics. Isis/Adrianna Tomaz and Black Adam fall in love, and become the joint rulers of Kahndaq.  The upcoming DCEU movie explores the life of Adrianna Tomaz before she gets the powers of the Egyptian goddess Isis, as she fights for her country and family. In a recent interview promoting Black Adam, Sarah Shahi explained Adrianna’s perception of the titular antihero. “Well, she can’t shoot electricity through her eyes…But no, she’s human. And they do have their similarities. She’s, for all purposes, a badass, although I hate that word. And they both have a lot in common in the sense that they were family people. She has a son. She lost her husband. He had a family that he had since lost.", "Related: Black Adam: Every DC Character Confirmed To Appear On social media, Shahi posted she was finally starting work on Black Adam, having first been cast a year ago. She shared her appreciation at getting the chance to play this role, and even revealed the name of her character. \"Very proud to represent my fellow middle eastern brothers and sisters as Adrianna,\" Shahi wrote. DC fans will recognize the name Adrianna and associate it with Adrianna Tomaz, Black Adam's wife and the hero Isis. You can see Shahi's full post down below. Adrianna has long been rumored to be a part of Black Adam, so it isn't too surprising that Shahi is actually playing her. However, her role as Adrianna seemingly also confirms the film will feature Isis. In the comics, Adrianna possess the Amulet of Isis, which bestows her with the powers of the goddess. It would make sense for Black Adam to show Adrianna in her superpowered form, perhaps suiting up alongside her husband for an epic battle. Of course, there are bound to be some changes in how Black Adam depicts Adrianna. For one thing, superhero movies these days are always putting some new spins on characters. For another, Shahi's initial casting described her character as \"a university professor and freedom fighter leading the resistance in Kahndaq."], "noise_rate": 0.8, "factlabel": 0}

In order to accomplish this, they tested the personalities for each character with a test group, who received the characters positively.[13] The writers also wanted to avoid portraying the Legion of Zoom as mere copies of their owners, to which they gave each vehicle their own characteristics, such as portraying Prank, the Joker's van, as \"a surfer dude\".[13]  The series' score was composed by Alex Geringas, while the theme song was performed and produced by Andy Sturmer,[12] who previously composed the themes for the series The Batman and Batman: The Brave and the Bold.
