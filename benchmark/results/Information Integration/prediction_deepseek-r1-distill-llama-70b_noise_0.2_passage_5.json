But the document also states that she amassed eight titles in 2022. That's a total of eight titles for Swiatek in 2022. I should note that down.\n\nNow, moving on to Novak Djokovic. The documents talk about his performance in 2022. On May 15, 2022, it says he won his first title of the year at the Italian Open. That's one title.

The document says he won the Italian Open in May, which is one. Then in October, he won another title, making it two. Then in the ATP Finals, which is a big tournament, he won that as well, so that's three titles in total for Djokovic in 2022.\n\nSo, putting it together, Swiatek won eight titles and Djokovic won three titles in 2022.\n</think>\n\nIn the 2022 season, Iga Swiatek won 8 titles, while Novak Djokovic won 3 titles. \n\nSwiatek's titles included two major titles, contributing to her total of three Grand Slam championships, and six other titles, making her season highly successful.

Swiatek reached the semifinals in Melbourne last season and is perhaps the biggest women's favorite to win a major title since Serena in her prime. Not to mention, the US Open victory gave her an extra dose of confidence about her game. \"It's a confirmation for me that [the] sky is the limit,\" she said in September. Swiatek started the 2023 season by leading the Polish team to the semifinals at the United Cup and recording straight-sets victories in her first three singles matches, including against Belinda Bencic.

In September, NBC and the HFPA announced the Globes’ return to its longtime broadcast television home in time for the awards show’s 80th anniversary.   Entertainment & Arts  Every year people complain about the awards show surplus. We finally got rid of the most absurd and corrupt of them — and now the Globes are back? Why?    NBC dropped the 2022 Globes broadcast  after a contingent of powerful publicists boycotted the organization and some studios — including Netflix and WarnerMedia — cut ties after The Times’ investigation.", "Planning and producing the Golden Globes ceremony annually will remain a focus, too. Earlier this year, the HFPA disclosed that the voting body for the 2024 competition will be comprised of 310 journalists from outside the US, a group which will include the organization’s 95 current members. In a statement, Dick Clark Productions’s CEO Jay Penske said: “As stewards of the Golden Globe Awards, our mission is to continue creating the most dynamic awards ceremony on live television viewed across the world. We have a great team in place to grow this iconic brand and captivate new and existing audiences to celebrate the very best in television and motion pictures.” The ceremony is currently scheduled for January 7, though there is not yet a broadcast partner for the awards show. It could feasibly end up on a major network or a streaming platform, as was the case for the SAG Awards, which aired live on Netflix’s  YouTube page earlier this year. On February 21, 2021, a Los Angeles Times investigation accused the HFPA of “self-dealing” and highlighted potential conflicts of interest. Among them was the fact that 30 HFPA members had been flown to France to visit the set of Emily in Paris in 2019. Two years later, the series was nominated for two Golden Globes, while more critically lauded shows like I May Destroy You were snubbed.", "And more than 100 Hollywood publicity firms called on the association to “eradicate the longstanding exclusionary ethos and pervasive practice of discriminatory behavior, unprofessionalism, ethical impropriety and alleged financial corruption.” Until the group made its plans for change public, the firms said, they would not advise their clients to engage with the group’s journalists. Now that the organization has outlined its plans for reform, publicists and agents say that some stars are open to participating, while others want the Globes to be permanently retired. Based on this year’s list of presenters — which include Billy Porter, Natasha Lyonne and Quentin Tarantino — many are planning to show up on Tuesday. Wait, aren’t awards shows usually on Sunday? Typically, but this one was bumped to avoid clashing with NBC’s “Sunday Night Football.” Held at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, Calif., the telecast will air at 8 p.m. Eastern time, 5 p.m. Pacific time on NBC. For the first time, the show will also be available simultaneously online, through NBCUniversal’s streaming service, Peacock. The comedian Jerrod Carmichael will be the master of ceremonies. His HBO special “Rothaniel,” in which he came out as gay, won an Emmy and was considered among the best of 2022.", "\"The HFPA remains committed to important changes and supporting programs which prioritize diversity, inclusion, and transparency. See you on January 10!\"\r \r Trophies were handed out to the best and brightest stars of film and TV in January 2022, but the celebration wasn't televised. NBC announced in May 2021 that it was pulling the 79th annual Golden Globes ceremony following allegations about the lack of diversity within HFPA. Months prior, the Los Angeles Times reported that there were no Black members among the organization's 87-person voting body.\r \r [jwplayer iEq8KknV-zhNYySv2]\r \r Celebrities were quick to speak out against the HFPA, with Scarlett Johansson calling for \"fundamental reform.\" Tom Cruise, meanwhile, returned his multiple Golden Globe statuettes.\r \r Last year marked the first time since 1979 that there was no telecast of the awards show. Winners were announced via social media and press releases — and no guests attended the scaled-back ceremony.\r \r After the organization took steps toward prioritizing inclusion, NBC agreed to put the event back on the air and acknowledged the HFPA's \"commitment to ongoing change.\"\r \r Among the impressive list of potential 2023 winners were several first-time nominees, including former Parks and Recreation costars Adam Scott (Severance) and Aubrey Plaza (The White Lotus).", "From Top Gun: Maverick and Elvis to Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, the movie categories boasted a wide-ranging group of nominees. Colin Farrell‘s The Banshees of Inisherin earned the highest number of nods with a total of eight — the most by any single film since 2004’s Cold Mountain.

Ben Bernanke, distinguished senior fellow in residence with the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings, is among three winners of this year’s Nobel Prize in economic sciences. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2022 to Dr. Bernanke, Douglas Diamond, and Philip Dybvig for significantly improving our understanding of the role of banks in the economy, particularly during financial crises. On Monday, October 10, the Brookings Institution hosted a press conference to hear his thoughts on the award and discuss his research on banks and financial crises.  The simple idea that the financial system can be a driver of economic activity and unemployment was not conventional wisdom at the time. In the announcement, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences cited Bernanke’s 1983 American Economic Review paper on banking and the Great Depression. Bernanke noted that looking back on the study, although it looked “a little primitive,” it had many fruitful ideas.", "Don Quixote, Gulliver's Travels, Jane Eyre, the tales of Grimm and Andersen, David Copperfield, Gone with the Wind, and later Les Misérables, The Grapes of Wrath, Nausea, The Stranger: chance, more than the school's prescriptions, determined what I read.\"[23]  Ernaux received her Nobel diploma and medal from Carl XVI Gustaf, King of Sweden, on 10 December 2022.

The character receives a mention (along with Ibac) in an episode of the animated series Young Justice. Sabbac's second host, Ishmael Gregor, appears as a recurring villain in Arrow: Season 5, but strictly in his role as a gangster from Oliver Queen's checkered past.  Sabbac will finally make his proper, live-action debut in the Black Adam movie, with Aladdin's Marwan Kenzari cast as Ishmael Gregor. Thanks to a leaked McFarlane Toys action figure, we know this version of Gregor is depicted as the leader of Intergang, one of the dominant criminal organizations in the DCU. But whereas Intergang is normally known for harnessing advanced weaponry and tech against heroes like Superman, it seems Gregor is turning to the supernatural realm in his fight against Black Adam and the Justice Society.   It's pretty clear already that the DCEU version of Sabbac isn't a particularly close adaptation of any of the comic book incarnations. He may instead draw elements from all three. Like Timothy Karnes, this version of Gregor may turn out to be a member of a family with centuries-old ties to Sabbac.", "Similar to how Shazam every letter in Shazam's name counts for something, Sabbac stands for Satan, Aym, Belial, Beelzebub, Asmodeus, and Crateis. The first Sabbac in the comic books was Timothy Karnes and he was succeeded by a Russian mob boss in New York, named Ishmael Gregor. Gregor was quite obsessed with finding the powers of Sabbac and with the help of his men went on a witch hunt to acquire it. Timothy Karnes at this point was incarcerated and had his voice box removed just so that he couldn't talk, and Gregor was immediately able to find him. After finding him, he initiated a demonic ritual that would help Karnes transform into Sabbac without ever having to speak. However, the ritual involved killing a passenger bus, filled with people. Gregor would then end up killing Karnes and take the power of Sabbac for himself and transform into a demonic monstrosity. The powers of Sabbac are basically the following:  These, round off the powers of this superhuman demon. We currently don't know who will be playing Sabbac in Black Adam, but it has been heavily rumored that Alladin actor Marwan Kenzari might be. The film might also make Ishmael into one of the Intergang as the supervillain group is looking for Black Adam to take him in.", "Related: Black Adam: Every DC Character Confirmed To Appear On social media, Shahi posted she was finally starting work on Black Adam, having first been cast a year ago. She shared her appreciation at getting the chance to play this role, and even revealed the name of her character. \"Very proud to represent my fellow middle eastern brothers and sisters as Adrianna,\" Shahi wrote. DC fans will recognize the name Adrianna and associate it with Adrianna Tomaz, Black Adam's wife and the hero Isis. You can see Shahi's full post down below. Adrianna has long been rumored to be a part of Black Adam, so it isn't too surprising that Shahi is actually playing her. However, her role as Adrianna seemingly also confirms the film will feature Isis. In the comics, Adrianna possess the Amulet of Isis, which bestows her with the powers of the goddess. It would make sense for Black Adam to show Adrianna in her superpowered form, perhaps suiting up alongside her husband for an epic battle. Of course, there are bound to be some changes in how Black Adam depicts Adrianna. For one thing, superhero movies these days are always putting some new spins on characters.

Reports suggest this card could launch at CES 2023.  This is based upon the GPU maker’s claim that: “The RTX 4080 12GB is a fantastic graphics card, but it’s not named right.” The RTX 4080 carries an MSRP of $1,199 which is on par with the launch price of the RTX 3080 Ti from last year. The now-shelved RTX 4080 12GB model would have sold for $899 by comparison.  The 4080 is $400 cheaper than the top-end Ada model though, and will likely deliver a better than even RTX 3090 Ti level of in-game performance at the upper crust of the spectrum.  If we compare the RTX 4080 to its Ampere equivalent, the RTX 3080, you’re paying double the MSRP.
