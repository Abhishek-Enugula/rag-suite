Sharpless awarded his second Nobel Prize in Chemistry–one of only two chemists to ever receive such an honor.  October 05, 2022 LA JOLLA, CA—Scripps Research professor K. Barry Sharpless, PhD, has been awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his groundbreaking research in developing “click chemistry,” an ingenious method for building molecules. Sharpless, the W.M. Keck Professor of Chemistry, shares the prize with Carolyn R. Bertozzi, PhD, of Stanford University and Morten Meldal, PhD, of the University of Copenhagen for the development of click chemistry and bioorthogonal chemistry, according to the Nobel Prize committee. Sharpless previously shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on chirally catalyzed oxidation reactions, making him the second scientist ever to win two Nobel Prizes in Chemistry. Frederick Sanger won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1958 and 1980. “Barry Sharpless has had a tremendous impact on chemistry, first with his development of asymmetric synthesis and now with his elegant ‘click chemistry,’” says Peter Schultz, PhD, President and CEO of Scripps Research. “His work opened whole new scientific frontiers that have had a major impact on the fields of chemistry, biology and medicine.", "Advertisement Supported by Alain Aspect, John F. Clauser and Anton Zeilinger were recognized for their experiments in an area that has broad implications for secure information transfer and quantum computing. By Isabella Kwai, Cora Engelbrecht and Dennis Overbye Three physicists whose works each showed that nature is even weirder than Einstein had dared to imagine have been named winners of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics. John Clauser, of J.F. Clauser and Associates in Walnut Creek, Calif.; Alain Aspect of the Institut d’Optique in Palaiseau, France; and Anton Zeilinger of the University of Vienna in Austria, will split a prize of 10 million Swedish kronor. Their independent works explored the foundations of quantum mechanics, the paradoxical rules that govern behavior in the subatomic world. In experiments conducted over the last 50 years, they confirmed the reality of an effect that Albert Einstein had disdained as “spooky action at a distance.” Measuring one of a widely separated pair of particles could instantaneously change the results of measuring the other particle, even if it was light-years away. Today, physicists call this strange effect quantum entanglement, and it is the basis of the burgeoning field of quantum information. When the award winners were announced on Tuesday, Eva Olsson, a member of the Nobel Committee for Physics, noted that quantum information science had broad implications in areas like cryptography and quantum computing.", "Oct 4, 2022 ...

Powell, Mike Hayes, Matt Meyer and Seán Federico O'Murchú, CNN Our Oscars live coverage has ended. Follow the latest entertainment news here or read through the updates below. From CNN's Lisa Respers France The 95th Academy Awards definitely wasn't like last year's ceremony – and for that, the people behind the scenes are probably breathing a sigh of relief. After \"the slap,\" the Academy instituted a crisis team that was on hand to make sure things didn't get out of hand. But Sunday night was devoid of that type of drama – and of many surprises. As expected, \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" was a big winner, taking home the awards for best actress, supporting actor and actress, best original screenplay, best picture and best directing categories. Brendan Fraser bested Austin Butler for best actor, which wasn't exactly an upset as they were both leading contenders. The closest thing that came to a shocker was Sarah Polley's win for best-adapted screenplay for \"Women Talking,\" a small film that felt very much the David that beat out the Goliath of a blockbuster, \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" in the category. All of this meant the show was allowed to let the talent and their heartfelt speeches shine.  From Ruth E.", "He will compete for the director prize against Spielberg, Todd Field (“Tár”), Martin McDonagh (“The Banshees of Inisherin”), and the directing duo of Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (“Everything Everywhere All at Once”). It’s a category dominated entirely by men. The last two best director winners, Jane Campion (“The Power of the Dog”) and Chloe Zhao (“Nomadland”), have been women, and there were some hopes that “Women Talking’s” Sarah Polley might nab a best director nod.  \tThe nominations were announced at a challenging time for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, the non-profit behind the awards, and the film business itself. Ratings for the Oscars have declined precipitously in recent years, imperiling the broadcast’s licensing fees, the leading source of revenue for the Academy. At the same time, adult-oriented movies such as “The Fabelmans,” “Tár” and “The Banshees of Inisherin” have struggled at the box office during the pandemic. Exacerbating the situation is the fact that streaming services, which helped fill the void left by the decline in theatrical revenues by providing a platform (and a blank check) for the artists behind them, are also shifting their priorities. Netflix, for instance, has signaled to Wall Street that it will keep content spending relatively flat while it focuses on increasing profits."], "noise_rate": 0.2, "factlabel": 0}

He defeated 24-year-old Norwegian clay specialist Casper Ruud 7-6(1), 6-3, 7-5. The 36-year-old is the first man to win at least three titles at each of the four majors. He and Serena Williams now share the tie for most Grand Slam titles behind Australian record-holder Margaret Court, who won 24 major women's singles titles. Ruud started strong, winning the first three games before Djokovic won his first. The opening losses weren't new for the Serbian star. It’s not the rope-a-dope, exactly, but he has lost the first set of major matches before and has almost always come storming back to even the score and crush his opponent.

If Djokovic could wait this long to hold this record, he certainly could wait for the half-hour or so it took to straighten out his strokes in the French Open final.

This year’s Costume Institute exhibition, “Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty,” celebrates the full work and life of Karl Lagerfeld, so the dress code was, fittingly, “in honor of Karl.” As Lagerfeld designed for many houses—including his eponymous brand, Patou, Balmain, Chloé, Fendi, and Chanel—attendees had no shortage of inspiration.  Below, everything you need to know about the 2023 Met Gala.  The 2023 Met Gala took place on Monday, May 1 in New York City. It celebrated the opening of the Costume Institute exhibition “Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty.”  Fans followed all the action on Vogue’s livestream.

The event is invite-only and carries a hefty price tag. This year, tickets to the event are reportedly $50,000 a piece, with prices for tables beginning at $300,000, according to the New York Times. What actually goes on inside the event is relatively secret, as celebrities are banned from posting photos or videos from inside on social media. However, official photos from past Met Galas offer a glimpse into the decorations and atmosphere inside the event.  Photos from inside the main lobby of last year's Met Gala show the red carpet, which continues from the bottom of the stairs into the entrance hall. The carpet, which changes from year to year, was colored red, white, and blue to represent the American flag and the 2022 theme, \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion.\" This year, the theme is \"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty,\" a homage to the legacy of the late designer and fashion-industry icon Karl Lagerfeld. The decorations and red carpet will likely be different from years past to reflect the new theme. The 2022 dress code was \"gilded glamour,\" inspired by the Gilded Age of New York City. To match the theme and dress code of the night, Shane Valentino designed the centerpiece to represent the Statue of Liberty's eternal flame.", "Invitations have been sent, the custom gowns and outfits are selected and the stars are ready to dazzle photographers on the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art at this year's Met Gala.  The gala is an annual fundraiser for the Met’s Costume Institute and calls on designers to adorn stars, models and sometimes influencers in the fashions of a selected theme to match a wing of the museum's exhibit. This year's exhibit is a continuation of last year's theme of American fashion and will include \"cinematic vignettes\" created by top Hollywood directors congruent with the \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion” theme.  While each year the event, largely considered the Oscars of fashion, has selected co-hosts and honorary hosts, Vogue's editor-in-chief Anna Wintour has been at the helm of the Met ball since 1995 curating a tight-knit invite list, seating arrangement and dress code — which is gilded glamour.  Met's best:Our favorite Met Gala looks of all time, from Rihanna to Princess Diana Last year's Met Gala, though pared down, occurred in September after being delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Honorary chairs for the evening are Tom Ford, Adam Mosseri, and Anna Wintour.  “Fashion is both a harbinger of cultural shifts and a record of the forces, beliefs, and events that shape our lives,” said Max Hollein, the Marina Kellen French Director of The Met. “This two-part exhibition considers how fashion reflects evolving notions of identity in America and explores a multitude of perspectives through presentations that speak with powerful immediacy to some of the complexities of history. In looking at the past through this lens, we can consider the aesthetic and cultural impact of fashion on historical aspects of American life.” Andrew Bolton, the Wendy Yu Curator in Charge of The Costume Institute, said: “American fashion has traditionally been described through the language of sportswear and ready-to-wear, emphasizing principles of simplicity, practicality, functionality, and egalitarianism.  Generally denied the emotional rhetoric applied to European fashion, American fashion has evolved a vernacular that tends to sit in direct opposition to that of the haute couture.", "Jun 1, 2022 ...

Everyone wants to be a hero. But what lengths might one go to get there? This is the winsome yet disturbing journey at the center of Susie Searches.  Kiersey Clemons stars as Susie Wallis, a socially awkward college student with a mind for solving mysteries. Naturally, she has her own true crime podcast called Susie Searches, so when fellow student/meditation influencer Jesse (Alex Wolff) goes missing, her interest in cracking the case isn't exactly selfless. If she finds the internet-adored victim, she and her podcast could score the validation she desperately craves. Whether she's squeezing the sheriff (Jim Gaffigan) for clues, eying a convenient creep (Ken Marino) as a suspect, or scouting out evidence, Susie is on a mission to save the day…and promote herself.  Forget the hardscrabble detectives of film noir; Susie has more in common with Oliver Putnam than she does Sam Spade. Rather than a gun and a trench coat, she carries a big smile smacked with colorful braces and a disarming demeanor that tends to make people underestimate her.

What does she really want? What are her motivations? She’s a meticulous girl and nothing, even early on before we get to the real discoveries, seem happen-chance.The color schemes and cinematography by Conor Murphy deliver an intriguing perspective as we keep Susie in our own investigative sights.

After the service, her coffin was taken to Windsor Castle, where she was laid to rest in the King George VI Memorial Chapel.", "docs": ["London (CNN)–The death of Queen Elizabeth II has set into motion an intricate period of mourning which will culminate with a huge state funeral on September 19 honoring her lifetime of devotion and steadfast service.            Codenamed “Operation London Bridge,” arrangements for Britain’s longest-serving monarch have been carefully pored over for years by the many agencies involved, with the Queen herself signing off on every single detail before her death. However, these details were kept under wraps until the sitting sovereign, King Charles III, gave it all his final seal of approval.            The Queen will ultimately be laid to rest within St. George’s Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle, alongside her “strength and stay” of 73 years, Prince Philip. Here, we’ve put together a day-by-day guide on what will happen from now until the state funeral.            Following the Queen’s death, her oak coffin – draped with the Royal Standard for Scotland and a wreath of flowers – sat in the ballroom at Balmoral, where estate staff had the chance to pay their last respects.            On Sunday morning, gamekeepers carried it to a waiting hearse, and then the beloved monarch left Balmoral for the last time. The first leg of the Queen’s final journey saw the royal cortege make a six-hour journey to Edinburgh and the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the official residence of the British monarch in Scotland.", "local ( 7 a.m. Eastern) the queen's coffin will be taken in a walking procession to Hyde Park, and then by hearse to St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, the sprawling estate west of London where the late monarch spent a lot of her life, and much of her last few years isolating amid the coronavirus pandemic. St. George's Chapel is the final resting place of the queen's sister, Princess Margaret, and her late husband, Prince Philip. It is the chapel often chosen by the royal family for events like weddings and funerals. It is where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Harry and Meghan, got married, and where Philip's funeral was held. Once her coffin arrives, at approximately 4 p.m. local (11 a.m. Eastern) a televised committal service will take place. The cameras will then be switched off for a private service to be held later in the evening for members of the royal family, at around 7:30 p.m. local (2:30 p.m. Eastern). The queen's funeral is expected to be one of the largest gatherings of royalty and politicians in the U.K. in decades. While the palace would not confirm attendance numbers, Westminster Abbey can hold over 2,000 people. World leaders were reportedly asked to travel to London on commercial flights if possible, and to make their way to Westminster on the day of the funeral on special buses arranged specifically for the occasion.", "Sep 18, 2022 ...

The pallbearers raised Queen Elizabeth II's coffin from the catafalque in the center of Westminster Abbey and began processing with it through the center aisle of the great nave, to bring it outside and place it back on the State Gun Carriage. The coffin will be followed in procession on the carriage by King Charles III and Camilla, the Queen Consort, along with other members of the family. The entire procession was to take about 45 minutes to reach Wellington Arch, at Hyde Park Corner. From there, the queen's coffin was to be placed in a hearse for the drive west from central London to Windsor, where the queen will be laid to rest in her family chapel next to her late husband Prince Philip.  Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby gave the commendation over the queen's coffin as the funeral service neared its end on Monday.  The commendation, essentially a prayer for the late queen to be welcomed into heaven, included the traditional line: \"Go forth, O Christian soul, from this world,\" which is often included in funeral services.", "The Queen was interred with her husband, Prince Philip, in the King George VI Memorial Chapel later that evening, in a private service attended only by her closest family.  The state funeral was the largest security operation ever mounted in the UK, and included dignitaries from around the world. The funeral was designated as a public holiday in the UK and several Commonwealth states. The state funeral was one of the United Kingdom's most watched special television broadcasts, surpassing the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the previous most watched royal event of the 21st century. The period of official mourning and the funeral was estimated to have cost the government £162 million.[1]  Queen Elizabeth II was in good health for most of her life; her health, however, declined significantly after the death of her husband, Prince Philip, in April 2021.[2] She began to use a walking stick for public engagements in October 2021.[3] On 20 October, the Queen stayed overnight in King Edward VII's Hospital in central London, necessitating the cancellation of scheduled visits to Northern Ireland and the COP26 summit in Glasgow.

This post originally appeared on Chicago Booth’s Initiative on Global Markets. The 2022 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences has been awarded to former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke of the Brookings Institution, Douglas Diamond at Chicago and Philip Dybvig at Washington University in St. Louis “for their research on banks and financial crises”. Anil Kashyap explains the rationale for this recognition. This year’s Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences should be thought of as recognizing the research that informs our thinking on three questions about banks: i) Among the many things that banks do, what are the essential features? ii) Why are banks the institutions that perform those functions? iii) What happens when things go wrong in the banking sector? The answers lie in three papers cited by the Nobel committee that all were published in the early 1980s: two theoretical contributions by Diamond and Dybvig (1983) and Diamond (1984); and an empirical contribution by Bernanke (1983). This research shows that the essence of banks is to take deposits that convey services (for example, checking accounts) from savers and use the funds to make loans to households and businesses. In other words, both bank assets (the loans) and liabilities (the deposits) are valuable and you can’t understand banking without recognizing both functions.", "LIVE   \t\t\t\tCommentary \t\t\t October 12, 2022  Economic Studies  This blog is a summary of an October 10, 2022 press conference with Dr. Ben Bernanke.

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2022 to Dr. Bernanke, Douglas Diamond, and Philip Dybvig for significantly improving our understanding of the role of banks in the economy, particularly during financial crises. On Monday, October 10, the Brookings Institution hosted a press conference to hear his thoughts on the award and discuss his research on banks and financial crises.  The simple idea that the financial system can be a driver of economic activity and unemployment was not conventional wisdom at the time. In the announcement, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences cited Bernanke’s 1983 American Economic Review paper on banking and the Great Depression.

Of course, there are bound to be some changes in how Black Adam depicts Adrianna. For one thing, superhero movies these days are always putting some new spins on characters.

Den of Geek: Thank you, Caitlin, for your service to this country. Along the way with Quantum Leap, have there been moments where your military background and knowledge has helped to shape, or even correct, a piece of the show’s narrative?  Caitlin Bassett: Oh certainly, I think the showrunners are kind and lovely and they rely on me to feel comfortable. When you’re playing and representing someone who you’ve been in real life…to a certain extent, I think the bar raises. I can’t say stupid things! I can’t say things that are just like, you know, totally incorrect. The showrunners are really kind about that, and they give me a lot of latitude. But truthfully, they’re very good. [Showrunner] Dean Georgaris has done a lot of military shows and movies and they work to get it right, and so they welcome [my experience]. They’re like: this is good right? And I’m like: yeah, just a little tweak here or a little tweak there. It’s been really collaborative and a wonderful working environment in that sense.  Brandon, seeing you on the screen in “S.O.S.,” XO Augustine and Addison are spitting images. What was your experience like guest starring as this character?", "Raymond Lee, who will appear in Top Gun: Maverick, is cast in the lead role of Ben Seong in NBC's highly-anticipated Quantum Leap reboot pilot. The Quantum Leap reboot series will star Top Gun: Maverick actor Raymond Lee in the lead role. The cult science-fiction TV show Quantum Leap was a television staple in the late '80s and '90s. Starring Scott Bakula as Dr. Sam Beckett, a scientist who inadvertently leaps through spacetime during time travel experiments, the show became a huge success and ran for five seasons and 97 episodes on NBC. The show was hugely influential, blending the genres of sci-fi, romance, drama, and social commentary, and remains one of the most influential TV shows ever. Following rumors of a possible remake or continuation, NBC greenlit an hour-long pilot, also called Quantum Leap, in January 2022. According to Deadline, Lee, who has previously appeared in episodes of Modern Family and How I Met Your Mother, will play the lead role of Dr. Ben Seong, a world-famous physicist working on a time travel project known as Quantum Leap. The character is said to be a spiritual successor to Beckett, who has been missing for 30 years, and Seong finds himself trapped in the 1980s after he uses the technology on himself.", "Martin Gero, Deborah Pratt, and Quantum Leap creator Don Bellisario are also executive producing the revival. The Quantum Leap revival will at least have a pilot episode before NBC makes decision about whether to order a new series. Are you looking forward to seeing Lee in the new Quantum Leap?

Configuration: Intel i9-12900k, 1440p, Ultra Settings In leaked benchmarks, this behemoth of a GPU managed to perform 82% better than the RTX 3090 in Time Spy Extreme, according to Kopite7Kimi. This is extremely promising for Nvidia’s upcoming GPU, and we believe that it will absolutely trample all over current consumer graphics cards available today.  In gaming workloads, leaked benchmarks suggest that the 4090 performs exceptionally. Leaker XpeaGPU revealed that the card managed to run Control at 4K, with Ray Tracing and DLSS on at a blisteringly fast 160FPS. This is no small feat for a game that is notorious for bringing many GPUs to their knees with how heavy it can run. Though, remember that these are leaked benchmarks, are by no means official, and can change compared to the final product. The RTX 4090 is available at all good electronics retailers. Though, we’ve seen many of them already go live, and have listed where you can buy these upcoming GPUs earlier in this article.

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 is a big deal because it potentially means we're one step closer to the end of the Great GPU Shortage. That's good news for PC gaming enthusiasts, who are finally breathing a sigh of relief now that the top GPUs just fell below MSRP and a fresh supply of cards is about to enter the market. Going forward, Nvidia will have to balance its drive to sell more cards with sensitivity to customers who have been eagerly awaiting the chance to buy a new GPU at a reasonable price. While the $1,599 price tag on the new 4090 is anything but, the other cards in Nvidia's new 40-series should be significantly cheaper. Hopefully, the company can do something to discourage scalpers and ensure more fans have a shot at buying one of these new cards at a fair price.
