Allegiant Stadium, the new home of the Raiders, will host Super Bowl 58, which is no surprise given that the NFL prioritizes hosting the Super Bowl at stadiums with recently updated and upgraded amenities. Location also plays a role in this, as the NFL has historically preferred warm-weather locations for stadiums without a dome. SoFi Stadium has a roof, but the sides of the structure are open. As such, it is considered an open-air stadium. Below are the sites the NFL has pinned as future Super Bowl locations. The Super Bowl halftime show will feature five rap and R&B legends in 2022. Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige and Kendrick Lamar will be the performers for the spectacle.

The AFC and NFC champions have been crowned, and the Bengals will now face the Rams to determine the NFL champion for the 2021 NFL season. The 2022 NFL playoffs proved as unpredictable as the regular season. Wild-card weekend largely went as expected, but after that, chaos reigned. Both of the No. 1 seeds, the Packers and Titans, lost their first game in the divisional round, as all but one of the underdogs won outright. The lone exception was the favored Chiefs, who mounted a game-tying drive with 13 seconds left before winning in overtime. The conference championship games were wild in their own right. Both the Bengals and Rams trailed by double digits in the second half of their wins over the Chiefs and 49ers. They mounted comebacks and as a result, the Bengals will have a chance to win their first Super Bowl in franchise history in their first appearance since 1989. Meanwhile, the Rams will have a chance to avenge their loss against the Patriots in the big game just three years ago. As unpredictable as the playoffs have been, the Super Bowl broadcast, location and date are set in stone.

After last year's contest in Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, the Super Bowl heads out west to SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, for Super Bowl 56. From then on, the Super Bowl will continue to be held in dome stadiums for a while. Each of the next three announced venues will have a roof over the heads of the fans and players, and will be in warmer weather areas, as is typical of the Super Bowl. Sporting News has you covered with all you need to know about the location of this year's Super Bowl, as well as the host site in future years. This year's Super Bowl will be held at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, California. The home of the Rams and the Chargers, SoFi Stadium was originally set to host the Super Bowl in 2021, however its opening was delayed until 2020, and NFL rules dictate that a stadium has to be open for at least two seasons before it can host the title game. This will be the third time the city has hosted the Super Bowl, with the L.A. Memorial Coliseum having hosted it twice (1967, 1973).

Their previous Super Bowl opponent has better odds, despite Tampa Bay returning all 22 starters from their Super Bowl squad. The Buccaneers are currently +600 to win it all in 2022, according to Vegas Insider. Behind the Buccaneers in the NFC are the Green Bay Packers (+1300), the San Francisco 49ers (+1400), and the Los Angeles Rams (+1400).

It’s not wild to assume they get back there, given they’ve been to the previous three conference championships and the last two Super Bowls.

In the decades since, we’ve been developing our technology to deliver on that mission. The progress we've made is because of our years of investment in advanced technologies, from AI to the technical infrastructure that powers it all. And once a year — on my favorite day of the year :) — we share an update on how it’s going at Google I/O. Today, I talked about how we’re advancing two fundamental aspects of our mission — knowledge and computing — to create products that are built to help. It’s exciting to build these products; it’s even more exciting to see what people do with them. Thank you to everyone who helps us do this work, and most especially our Googlers.

Google I/O is an annual developer conference hosted by Google, where the company showcases its latest technologies and products. The conference typically features keynote speeches, technical sessions, and product announcements, and attracts both developers and consumers. Google announced Google I/O 2023 through a blog post on the official Google Developers website in March. The post revealed the dates and format of the event and invited interested attendees to register for the event. The announcement was also shared on Google's social media channels. Like previous years, Google also teased the event with a binary field puzzle that fans had to solve to reveal the launch date. Googgle I/O 20213 took place on 10 May. The keynote occurred at 10am PT and lasted about two hours. Google I/O 2023 was broadcast online and is still available to everyone to watch.

Google I/O 2022 will be held on May 11 and May 12 at the Shoreline Amphitheater. The event will kick off with Sundar Pichai’s “Google I/O keynote” at 10 AM. This will be the main attraction for the general population as the main event tends to be more consumer-focused. While the event’s description doesn’t provide specifics, expect to see announcements for popular Google services, Workspace, privacy, health, and Google’s other new projects and endeavors. Also, keep an eye out for potential hardware announcements in the form of the Pixel 6a, Pixel Watch, and smart home devices. The main keynote will be followed by the Developer keynote and “What’s new in Android.” This is where we expect to learn more about Android 13, Wear OS, and updates to developer products and tools.

For those assessing the opportunities and risks related to GPT-4, it is useful to consider the extent of the stated technical and safety improvements and the limitations of the release. GPT-4 is the newest version of OpenAI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer model. Like previous versions of GPT, GPT-4 is a transformer-based large language model that is pre-trained using both publicly available data (such as internet data) and third-party licensed data to generate text output based on input prompts. GPT is the foundation model behind ChatGPT (the well-known model based on GPT that OpenAI fine-tuned for a chatbot experience). Open AI’s GPT-4 Technical Report states that GPT-4 demonstrates substantial improvements in performance and capabilities from GPT-3.5, including the ability to: Regarding hallucinations, GPT-4 scored 19% higher than GPT-3.5 in an OpenAI internal, adversarially-designed factuality evaluation.[1] GPT-4, with fine-tuning, also showed improvements over GPT-3.5 based on publicly available benchmarks such as TruthfulQA.", "5 series, according to OpenAI.  However, with a subscription to ChatGPT Plus, you can access ChatGPT with GPT-4, Open AI's most advanced model.  Also: Here's a deep dive into how ChatGPT works  Generative AI models of this type are trained on vast amounts of information from the internet, including websites, books, news articles, and more.  The language model was fine-tuned using supervised learning as well as reinforcement learning. The use of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is what makes ChatGPT especially unique.  Through RLHF, human AI trainers provided the model with conversations in which they played both parts, the user and AI assistants, according to OpenAI.  ChatGPT is a language model created to hold a conversation with the end user. A search engine indexes web pages on the internet to help the user find the information they asked for. The free version of ChatGPT does not have the ability to search the internet for information. It uses the information it learned from training data to generate a response, which leaves room for error.  Also: ChatGPT or Google: Which gives the best answers? Another major difference is that ChatGPT only has access to information up to 2021, whereas a regular search engine like Google has access to the latest information.", "The latest update for ChatGPT We’re rolling out a bunch of small updates to improve the ChatGPT experience.

All rights reserved.", "Susie Searches is thus a quirky look at the destructive nature of popularity and the collateral damage that results when its preservation becomes more important than being “good.” I would question whether it’s able to sustain its initial enjoyment level, though—the whole is more cutely biting than uproariously funny, and such tone can prove tiring if the narrative doesn’t find a new gear to drive things forward. When it’s just Susie having to confront the reality that her choices have sent her into a freefall necessitating an embracement of the unethical, things get stale no matter how endearing or effective the characterizations prove. And Anne becoming non-verbal seems a missed opportunity once Susie’s prime suspect is found innocent. Only she knows her daughter is never wrong. Thus we’re left in limbo. Susie operates out of pragmatism, not malice. We can’t “enjoy” her choices as much as wince in anticipation of her inevitable comeuppance because she’s not an anti-hero. We’re not supposed to give her the benefit of the doubt. By not having Anne as a logical point of conflict, however, there’s no one else to sustainably root for. Maybe Loggins or Jessie’s suspicious friend Ray (Isaac Powell), but they become more red herring or potential victim than any real adversarial threat. And maybe that’s the point.", "When fellow well-known and beloved student Jesse (Alex Wolff) goes missing, she’s quick on the case and when success knocks upon her door, she’s flooded with fans and fame.  There’s an element of the “search” as much as there is a degree of internal discovery as we learn more about Susie’s character. What does she really want? What are her motivations? She’s a meticulous girl and nothing, even early on before we get to the real discoveries, seem happen-chance.The color schemes and cinematography by Conor Murphy deliver an intriguing perspective as we keep Susie in our own investigative sights. Jon Natchez composes a score that accompanies the ups and downs of our protagonist’s moods ensuring that the thrilling nature of the story is pronounced.What occurs after is most enjoyed by the discovery but ends up being both light-hearted and fun, obsessive and sad. Susie isn’t a selfless character, nearly not likable on paper, but Clemons insists that she is. That strength in conviction makes Susie Searches much more, and  Clemon’s affable demeanor helps elevate it.There are also some terrific supporting comedic roles with sheriff Jim Gaffigan and Ken Marino, both are winningly charming (or disconcerting) in their own ways.  Also shoutout to Rachel Sennott as Susie’s co-worker, stealing most scenes that she is in.", "In 2020's \"Susie Searches,\" she also starred as the brace-faced sleuth. However, in re-imaging the conceit for a feature-length film, she and William Day Frank have smartly pivoted to build a string of reveals that keeps the macabre thrills coming. Admittedly, these jolts can make the movie feel episodic, leading me to wonder if they'd initially conceived of this as a web series or TV show. In the right headspace, this uneven ride can feel like binge-watching an addictive limited series. And, frankly, I value the rough edges when they come with such unexpected fun.  For the first act, Susie Searches runs the risk of feeling dated, presenting an amateur detective in the guileless light of literal kids stuff, like Harriet the Spy or Scooby Doo. At this point, we've been so glutted with crime shows that this tact feels tired. However, as Susie solves her mystery, the movie moves into motivations, urging the audience to reconsider their heroine, to re-examine the clues, and to question whether what we want is justice or just a good story.  Kargman and Day weave together a deceptively chipper tone with a cynical thread and an appetite for tension for a finale that is outrageous and rewarding."], "noise_rate": 0.6, "factlabel": 0}

He’s playing like the No. 1 player in the world. It’s not apples to apples like other years.” Under the normal points system, Djokovic might not even qualify for the ATP Finals in Turin, Italy, this year. Heading into Paris, he was in 10th place in the points race. But under the ATP’s Grand Slam champion rule, any player who wins a major title and is ranked within the top 20 is guaranteed a spot in the year-end championship. (The WTA Tour has no such rule, which is why Djokovic’s fellow Wimbledon champion, Elena Rybakina, did not qualify for the WTA Finals in Fort Worth.) “Most of the upheaval this year is because of Djokovic,” Patrick McEnroe, a former United States Davis Cup captain and now an ESPN commentator said. “He missed two majors and didn’t get points for the one he won. It really affected the rest of the field. You could make the case that if Djokovic runs the table, wins Paris and the ATP Finals, that he deserves to be No. 1.” The player most likely to end 2022 at No. 1 is Alcaraz.

The figure was down from the 8.5% mark recorded in July and the 9.1% inflation rate in June, which was the biggest increase in four decades.  Even as U.S. motorists have gladly watched gasoline prices fall sharply in recent weeks — down 10.6% from their peak — costs for food and apartment rentals have continued to increase.  Overall, as a result, the government said that consumer prices were up one-tenth of a percent in August, compared to July.  Food prices were up 0.8 percent in the past month, while costs for housing, medical care, new cars and household furnishings all increased in August compared to July.

By Radhika Seth On June 12, 2023, after enduring years of controversy, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the organization that founded the Golden Globes, announced that it would be closing. However, it seems this is not the end for the famously raucous ceremony, which has kicked off awards season for the past 80 years. Here’s everything you need to know about the 2024 Golden Globe Awards, and how we ended up here. By all accounts, yes. Eldridge Industries, a holding company owned by the billionaire investor Todd Boehly, and Dick Clark Productions, which has produced the Golden Globes telecast for decades, have reportedly agreed to purchase the HFPA’s Golden Globes assets, rights, and properties for an undisclosed price. They’ll form a new non-profit, the Golden Globe Foundation, which will continue the philanthropic work of the HFPA. (The organization has given more than $50 million to entertainment-related charities over the last 30 years.) Meanwhile, a yet-to-be-named for-profit entity will also seek to expand the Golden Globes as a brand.", "Presenters include Quentin Tarantino, Ana de Armas, Jamie Lee Curtis, Billy Porter, Ana Gasteyer, Colman Domingo, Michaela Jaé Rodriguez, Natasha Lyonne, Nicole Byer, Niecy Nash-Betts, Tracy Morgan, Claire Danes, Cole Hauser, Harvey Guillén, Henry Golding, Hilary Swank, Glen Powell, Jay Ellis, Jenna Ortega, Jennifer Coolidge, Jennifer Hudson, Letitia Wright, Mo Brings Plenty, Regina Hall, and Salma Hayek Pinault.   Watch the 2023 Golden Globes live on NBC on January 10 starting at 8/7c.

Awards  Winners of the 2023 Golden Globes include “House of the Dragon,” “Fabelmans,” “Abbott Elementary” and “The Banshees of Inisherin.”   The 80th Golden Globe Awards — which honors projects across film and television  and typically kicks off the awards season — will air at 5 p.m. Pacific Tuesday on NBC and will be streamed on the network’s premium Peacock service. The show will take place at its usual haunt, the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills.  In September, NBC and the HFPA announced the Globes’ return to its longtime broadcast television home in time for the awards show’s 80th anniversary.   Entertainment & Arts  Every year people complain about the awards show surplus. We finally got rid of the most absurd and corrupt of them — and now the Globes are back? Why?    NBC dropped the 2022 Globes broadcast  after a contingent of powerful publicists boycotted the organization and some studios — including Netflix and WarnerMedia — cut ties after The Times’ investigation.", "Planning and producing the Golden Globes ceremony annually will remain a focus, too. Earlier this year, the HFPA disclosed that the voting body for the 2024 competition will be comprised of 310 journalists from outside the US, a group which will include the organization’s 95 current members. In a statement, Dick Clark Productions’s CEO Jay Penske said: “As stewards of the Golden Globe Awards, our mission is to continue creating the most dynamic awards ceremony on live television viewed across the world. We have a great team in place to grow this iconic brand and captivate new and existing audiences to celebrate the very best in television and motion pictures.” The ceremony is currently scheduled for January 7, though there is not yet a broadcast partner for the awards show. It could feasibly end up on a major network or a streaming platform, as was the case for the SAG Awards, which aired live on Netflix’s  YouTube page earlier this year. On February 21, 2021, a Los Angeles Times investigation accused the HFPA of “self-dealing” and highlighted potential conflicts of interest. Among them was the fact that 30 HFPA members had been flown to France to visit the set of Emily in Paris in 2019.

Anil Kashyap explains the rationale for this recognition. This year’s Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences should be thought of as recognizing the research that informs our thinking on three questions about banks: i) Among the many things that banks do, what are the essential features? ii) Why are banks the institutions that perform those functions? iii) What happens when things go wrong in the banking sector? The answers lie in three papers cited by the Nobel committee that all were published in the early 1980s: two theoretical contributions by Diamond and Dybvig (1983) and Diamond (1984); and an empirical contribution by Bernanke (1983). This research shows that the essence of banks is to take deposits that convey services (for example, checking accounts) from savers and use the funds to make loans to households and businesses. In other words, both bank assets (the loans) and liabilities (the deposits) are valuable and you can’t understand banking without recognizing both functions.", "More than a dozen French writers have captured the literature prize, though Ernaux is the first French woman to win, and just the 17th woman among the 119 Nobel literature laureates.

How’s Addison feeling about Ziggy right now?  Ad Ad – content continues below Caitlin Bassett: Ziggy is just doing the most and will continue to do the most throughout this season. At the end of the day you still have got to get the job done. Sometimes stuff doesn’t work, and Ziggy doesn’t work a lot! But that gives us as actors and us as characters the opportunity to prove to ourselves every time that we can figure this out. It’s much more fun to play that as an actor, everybody using their own abilities to solve the problem rather than a computer giving it to you. That’s more fun anyway and from the character’s perspective Addison’s like: alright, Ziggy needs to get its stuff together. But, either way, Addison has a job to do, so she’s going to do that job either way.  Addison had a great moment in episode 13, “Family Style,” when she commented about how Ziggy can’t predict unscrupulous behavior very well—Ziggy can’t predict what bad people are going to do.   Caitlin Bassett: Yeah, it can’t. Ziggy’s not a person. There’s too many probabilities and then you just get bogged down.

It also costs $1,600 for the Founders Edition, but you’ll find many versions of the card up for sale for $2,000 to $2,500. Nvidia’s choice to price the RTX 4090 the way it did was not the most popular decision it has ever made. After a couple of years of GPU shortage, most of us are tired of having to pay insane prices for our PC hardware. To see Nvidia not just continue that trend, but also tell its customers outright that cheaper GPUs are a thing of the past, was disheartening. Still, the RTX 4090 sold out and came back at scalper prices, with some eBay sales on launch day reaching as high as $5,000. There was a single sale for $9,999, but it’s hard to believe that this was a legitimate purchase. The insanity of these prices made some of us actually look forward to the (also overpriced) RTX 4080, set with an MSRP (recommended price) of $1,200. Unfortunately, once the card arrived, the taste of excitement grew bitter with a large heap of disappointment.", "When firing on all cylinders, Nvidia claims DLSS 3 can improve game framerates by up to 4x what they are without DLSS. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 is a big deal because it potentially means we're one step closer to the end of the Great GPU Shortage. That's good news for PC gaming enthusiasts, who are finally breathing a sigh of relief now that the top GPUs just fell below MSRP and a fresh supply of cards is about to enter the market. Going forward, Nvidia will have to balance its drive to sell more cards with sensitivity to customers who have been eagerly awaiting the chance to buy a new GPU at a reasonable price. While the $1,599 price tag on the new 4090 is anything but, the other cards in Nvidia's new 40-series should be significantly cheaper. Hopefully, the company can do something to discourage scalpers and ensure more fans have a shot at buying one of these new cards at a fair price.

Configuration: Intel i9-12900k, 1440p, Ultra Settings In leaked benchmarks, this behemoth of a GPU managed to perform 82% better than the RTX 3090 in Time Spy Extreme, according to Kopite7Kimi. This is extremely promising for Nvidia’s upcoming GPU, and we believe that it will absolutely trample all over current consumer graphics cards available today.  In gaming workloads, leaked benchmarks suggest that the 4090 performs exceptionally. Leaker XpeaGPU revealed that the card managed to run Control at 4K, with Ray Tracing and DLSS on at a blisteringly fast 160FPS. This is no small feat for a game that is notorious for bringing many GPUs to their knees with how heavy it can run. Though, remember that these are leaked benchmarks, are by no means official, and can change compared to the final product. The RTX 4090 is available at all good electronics retailers. Though, we’ve seen many of them already go live, and have listed where you can buy these upcoming GPUs earlier in this article.  It’s likely that we will see more AIB cards hit the market after the initial launch, from the likes of companies like PALIT and more. However, these are likely to come some weeks after launch, possibly due to logistical reasons.", "Though, this may indicate that many consumers might not be lapping up Nvidia’s Ada Lovelace graphics cards as quickly as they were before. However, features such as DLSS 3 may go a long way to convince users to go with Nvidia’s lineup when compared to AMD.  The RTX 4080 16GB is priced at $1199. We previously speculated that the now-canceled RTX 4080 12GB would even make it to market as an RTX 4070, but Nvidia was paralyzed over what to actually define it as earlier this year, it appears that the same has happened once again. Now, it appears that it’ll come back as an RTX 4070 Ti.  It’s a tricky one, though for those looking for value. We’re currently witnessing existing GPUs drop in price after cryptocurrency bottomed out spectacularly and hasn’t recovered. After Ethereum moved on from mining via GPUs, there’s been a flood on the secondary market for 30-series models, which could call into question the value of the new GPUs.  The RTX 4080 is incredibly quick, especially in Overwatch 2. At 1440p, Ultra settings, the RTX 4080 16GB manages to push around 470 FPS. In additional benchmarks, you can also expect stellar performance, thanks to its fantastic specifications.", "The RTX 4090 also possesses a higher MSRP than the RTX 3090, which was launched at $1499. This bump of $100 is actually fairly good pricing, considering inflation in the subsequent years, too.  It’s tough to tell what demand might look like for the RTX 4090, but since it will retain Nvidia’s power crown, and will potentially be one of the best graphics cards in 2023. The RTX 4090 was released on October 12. However, while Nvidia enjoys the launch of the 4090, its 30-series cards are now gaining even more popularity.  Due to an oversupply, Nvidia has cut the price of current-generation high-end graphics cards, and the newer RTX 40-series GPUs are priced slightly higher.  The RTX 4090 manages to boast incredibly impressive specifications on paper, with even more impressive results in gaming scenarios like in Overwatch 2. We’ve listed the full specifications of the 4090 below. You’ll be able to find extensive benchmarks of the GPU in our full review.  According to Nvidia’s own benchmarks, the GPU can produce the following results compared against a system using an i9-12900k, equipped with a 3090 Ti with 32GB of RAM.

Taking a page from the same playbook, WarnerMedia has debuted the Batwheels cartoon, DC’s first-ever Batman preschool series that follows the Batman Family along with his amazing team of super-vehicles offering young viewers a high-speed, vibrant CGI-animated iteration of the Caped Crusader. During New York Comic Con we had the chance to chat with some of the talent behind this high-speed, vibrant CGI-animated series including executive producers Michael G. Stern and Simon J. Smith as well as voice actors Jacob Bertrand (Bam), Lilimar (Batwing), Xolo Maridueña (Snowy), and AJ Hudson (Duke Thomas/Robin). Taimur Dar: When this Batwheels cartoon was first announced, the concept of talking vehicles definitely reminded me of shows I grew up watching like Thomas the Tank Engine. I’m curious how this show came about?  Michael G. Stern: DC and Warner Bros. Animation had wanted to find a way to connect young kids to their heroes and they had sort of been struggling to do it.

In order to accomplish this, they tested the personalities for each character with a test group, who received the characters positively.[13] The writers also wanted to avoid portraying the Legion of Zoom as mere copies of their owners, to which they gave each vehicle their own characteristics, such as portraying Prank, the Joker's van, as \"a surfer dude\".[13]  The series' score was composed by Alex Geringas, while the theme song was performed and produced by Andy Sturmer,[12] who previously composed the themes for the series The Batman and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. Sturmer also co-wrote the theme alongside Stern.[12]", "By: Author Mirko Parlevliet  Posted on Published: May 19, 2022 Cartoonito is revving up for Batwheels, announcing today the DC Super-Villain voice cast lineup.
