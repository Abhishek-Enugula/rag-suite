Bertozzi, Morten Meldal and K. Barry Sharpless were honored for their advances in “click chemistry,” which has played a role in treating and diagnosing illnesses. By Cora Engelbrecht, Euan Ward and Oliver Whang The 2022 Nobel Prize in Chemistry has been awarded to three scientists whose work harnessed the power of molecular interaction and introduced new, unobtrusive ways of studying the natural world. Carolyn R. Bertozzi of Stanford University, Morten Meldal of the University of Copenhagen and K. Barry Sharpless of Scripps Research will share the prize, which honors the scientists’ independent research that resulted in the development of what is known as click chemistry and bio-orthogonal chemistry. The three researchers will also split a prize of 10 million Swedish kronor, around $900,000. Their works have “led to a revolution in how chemists think about linking molecules together,” said Johan Aqvist, the chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry. In winning the award on Wednesday, Dr. Sharpless became only the fifth person to win two Nobels, having received the chemistry prize in 2001 for his work on chirally catalyzed oxidation reactions. The other two-time winners were Marie Curie, John Bardeen, Linus Pauling and Frederick Sanger.

The Nobel Prize in physics for 2022 is being awarded to Alain Aspect, John F. Clauser and Anton Zeilinger for their work on quantum mechanics, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced on October 4, 2022.  The 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded “for experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities, and pioneering quantum information science,” the academy said. The 2022 physics laureates’ development of experimental tools has laid the foundation for a new era of quantum technology. Being able to manipulate and manage quantum states and all their layers of properties gives us access to tools with unexpected potential.  Intense research and development are underway to utilise the special properties of individual particle systems to construct quantum computers, improve measurements, build quantum networks and establish secure quantum encrypted communication. This year’s Nobel Prize laureate John Clauser built an apparatus that emitted two entangled photons at a time, each towards a filter that tested their polarisation. The result was a clear violation of a Bell inequality and agreed with the predictions of quantum mechanics.", "The Nobel Prize in Physics 2022 was awarded to Alain Aspect, John F.

Also, keep an eye out for potential hardware announcements in the form of the Pixel 6a, Pixel Watch, and smart home devices.

OpenAI also recommends that users of GPT-4 establish protocols that match the needs of the user’s specific application of GPT-4 (such as “human review, grounding with additional context, or avoiding high-stakes uses altogether”).[18] As President and Co-Founder of OpenAI Greg Brockman said during the March 14, 2023 developer demo live stream, GPT-4 works best when used in tandem with people who check its work—it is “an amplifying tool” that when used together with humans allows us to “reach new heights,” but it “is not perfect” and neither are humans.

Codenamed “Operation London Bridge,” arrangements for Britain’s longest-serving monarch have been carefully pored over for years by the many agencies involved, with the Queen herself signing off on every single detail before her death. However, these details were kept under wraps until the sitting sovereign, King Charles III, gave it all his final seal of approval.            The Queen will ultimately be laid to rest within St. George’s Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle, alongside her “strength and stay” of 73 years, Prince Philip. Here, we’ve put together a day-by-day guide on what will happen from now until the state funeral.            Following the Queen’s death, her oak coffin – draped with the Royal Standard for Scotland and a wreath of flowers – sat in the ballroom at Balmoral, where estate staff had the chance to pay their last respects.            On Sunday morning, gamekeepers carried it to a waiting hearse, and then the beloved monarch left Balmoral for the last time.

The state funeral was the largest security operation ever mounted in the UK, and included dignitaries from around the world. The funeral was designated as a public holiday in the UK and several Commonwealth states. The state funeral was one of the United Kingdom's most watched special television broadcasts, surpassing the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the previous most watched royal event of the 21st century. The period of official mourning and the funeral was estimated to have cost the government £162 million.[1]  Queen Elizabeth II was in good health for most of her life; her health, however, declined significantly after the death of her husband, Prince Philip, in April 2021.[2] She began to use a walking stick for public engagements in October 2021.[3] On 20 October, the Queen stayed overnight in King Edward VII's Hospital in central London, necessitating the cancellation of scheduled visits to Northern Ireland and the COP26 summit in Glasgow. She suffered a sprained back in November, which prevented her from attending the 2021 National Service of Remembrance.[4][5][6][7]  In February 2022, during the COVID-19 pandemic in England, the Queen was one of several people at Windsor Castle to test positive for COVID-19.", "\"So I said to [Queen Elizabeth II], 'How did you manage?'

The coffin will be followed in procession on the carriage by King Charles III and Camilla, the Queen Consort, along with other members of the family. The entire procession was to take about 45 minutes to reach Wellington Arch, at Hyde Park Corner. From there, the queen's coffin was to be placed in a hearse for the drive west from central London to Windsor, where the queen will be laid to rest in her family chapel next to her late husband Prince Philip.  Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby gave the commendation over the queen's coffin as the funeral service neared its end on Monday.  The commendation, essentially a prayer for the late queen to be welcomed into heaven, included the traditional line: \"Go forth, O Christian soul, from this world,\" which is often included in funeral services.", "Sep 14, 2022 ...

However, her role as Adrianna seemingly also confirms the film will feature Isis. In the comics, Adrianna possess the Amulet of Isis, which bestows her with the powers of the goddess. It would make sense for Black Adam to show Adrianna in her superpowered form, perhaps suiting up alongside her husband for an epic battle. Of course, there are bound to be some changes in how Black Adam depicts Adrianna. For one thing, superhero movies these days are always putting some new spins on characters. For another, Shahi's initial casting described her character as \"a university professor and freedom fighter leading the resistance in Kahndaq.", "And I'm a much different man and actor than I was ten years ago. Even then, ten years ago, I just wanted to wait for the timing to feel right. And it feels like now, the man that I've become, I'm able to bring a little bit of my own life lessons and philosophies and engrain them in the DNA of this character.\" Black Adam is due to be directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (The Shallows, Run All Night) and is now scheduled to be released on 29 July 2022.

Being surrounded by Intergang soldiers, Adrianna reads the inscriptions on the rocks and frees Teth-Adam from his 5000 year imprisonment and allows him to kill Intergang personnel while allowing Adrianna to escape with her brother Karim and the crown, and also to Adam after being injured. In the fight between Adam and Justice Society, she has them join forces to save her son Amon, who was captured by his partner Ishmael Gregor, who turned out to be the militant leader of Intergang. After Adam saved Amon from being killed by Ishmael, she discovers that his death allowed him to be reborn as the demon Sabbac. Adrianna, Amon and Karim rally the people of Khandaq to fight Sabbac's skeleton army while Teth-Adam and the Justice Society defeat Sabbac.", "Hopefully the casting news is leading to production finally starting.

It’s much more fun to play that as an actor, everybody using their own abilities to solve the problem rather than a computer giving it to you. That’s more fun anyway and from the character’s perspective Addison’s like: alright, Ziggy needs to get its stuff together. But, either way, Addison has a job to do, so she’s going to do that job either way.  Addison had a great moment in episode 13, “Family Style,” when she commented about how Ziggy can’t predict unscrupulous behavior very well—Ziggy can’t predict what bad people are going to do.   Caitlin Bassett: Yeah, it can’t.

Configuration: Intel i9-12900k, 1440p, Ultra Settings In leaked benchmarks, this behemoth of a GPU managed to perform 82% better than the RTX 3090 in Time Spy Extreme, according to Kopite7Kimi. This is extremely promising for Nvidia’s upcoming GPU, and we believe that it will absolutely trample all over current consumer graphics cards available today.  In gaming workloads, leaked benchmarks suggest that the 4090 performs exceptionally. Leaker XpeaGPU revealed that the card managed to run Control at 4K, with Ray Tracing and DLSS on at a blisteringly fast 160FPS. This is no small feat for a game that is notorious for bringing many GPUs to their knees with how heavy it can run. Though, remember that these are leaked benchmarks, are by no means official, and can change compared to the final product. The RTX 4090 is available at all good electronics retailers. Though, we’ve seen many of them already go live, and have listed where you can buy these upcoming GPUs earlier in this article.

Sadly, while it stands tall next to its RTX 4090 sibling, it’s probably not the 80-class successor you’ve been waiting for, as it flies a bit too close to the premium price point sun.   The best graphics card battlefield currently feels a bit topsy-turvy, as AMD’s top GPU, the Radeon RX 7900 XTX, is actually an RTX 4080 rival that costs $899 USD. I can’t say for sure whether the RDNA 3 card will use the Lovelace card’s lofty price against it, but it’s certainly worth keeping in mind while judging Nvidia’s contender.    The RTX 4080, however, comes in at $1,199 USD / £1,269 GBP – $500 more than the RTX 3080 at launch. In a way, I feel bad for the next-gen newcomer, as its debut is haunted by both the now canceled 12GB model and its out-of-place price.", "Nov 29, 2022 ...

That might not sound like much of a hike, but if you haven’t invested in a card since the release of the RTX 2080 Super, it’s a significant jump.    It’s worth noting that the Asus TUF RTX 4090 matches Nvidia’s $1,599 MSRP, so you won’t have to fork out more for the overclocked card. I’d argue the cooling efficacy of the model’s Axial-tech setup makes picking the variant over the original reference design worthwhile, but its extra chonk contributes to the GPU’s unattractive form.    At the moment, you can grab a Zotac RTX 3090 Ti for under $1,000, – a former flagship graphics card still packs a serious 4K punch. Of course, picking up the older Ampere GPU means you’ll miss out on DLSS 3.0, and future budget options like the RTX 4060 will potentially provide a similar ray tracing experience.    Ultimately, the RTX 4090 is more than a gaming GPU, as it caters to a very specific group of enthusiasts.
