Both of the No. 1 seeds, the Packers and Titans, lost their first game in the divisional round, as all but one of the underdogs won outright. The lone exception was the favored Chiefs, who mounted a game-tying drive with 13 seconds left before winning in overtime. The conference championship games were wild in their own right. Both the Bengals and Rams trailed by double digits in the second half of their wins over the Chiefs and 49ers. They mounted comebacks and as a result, the Bengals will have a chance to win their first Super Bowl in franchise history in their first appearance since 1989. Meanwhile, the Rams will have a chance to avenge their loss against the Patriots in the big game just three years ago. As unpredictable as the playoffs have been, the Super Bowl broadcast, location and date are set in stone.

It was directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki with worldbuilding provided by fantasy writer George R. R. Martin. It was released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on February 25 by FromSoftware in Japan and Bandai Namco Entertainment internationally. Players control a customizable player character who is on a quest to repair the Elden Ring and become the new Elden Lord.  Elden Ring is presented through a third-person perspective; players freely roam its interactive open world. The six main areas are traversed using the player character's steed Torrent as the primary mode of travel. Linear, hidden dungeons can be explored to find useful items. Players can use several types of weapons and magic spells, including non-direct engagement enabled by stealth mechanics. Throughout the game's world, checkpoints enable fast travel and allow players to improve their attributes using an in-game currency called Runes. Elden Ring has an online multiplayer mode in which players can join each other for cooperative and player-versus-player combat.  During planning, FromSoftware wanted to create an open-world game with gameplay similar to Dark Souls; the company wanted Elden Ring to act as an evolution of the self-titled debut of the series.

Martin. Miyazaki has said that Elden Ring will be “full of things that we weren’t able to do in the Dark Souls series.” The game will focus “more heavily on RPG elements,” Miyazaki said in an interview from 2019, and “will include a wide variety of weapons, magic, and ways to engage enemies, that make it possible to provide users with a style of gameplay and strategy that suits them.” FromSoftware fans have since been wracked with Elden Ring-information withdrawal, leading the community to fill the void with its own, self-created lore.

The state funeral was one of the United Kingdom's most watched special television broadcasts, surpassing the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the previous most watched royal event of the 21st century. The period of official mourning and the funeral was estimated to have cost the government £162 million.[1]  Queen Elizabeth II was in good health for most of her life; her health, however, declined significantly after the death of her husband, Prince Philip, in April 2021.[2] She began to use a walking stick for public engagements in October 2021.[3] On 20 October, the Queen stayed overnight in King Edward VII's Hospital in central London, necessitating the cancellation of scheduled visits to Northern Ireland and the COP26 summit in Glasgow. She suffered a sprained back in November, which prevented her from attending the 2021 National Service of Remembrance.[4][5][6][7]  In February 2022, during the COVID-19 pandemic in England, the Queen was one of several people at Windsor Castle to test positive for COVID-19.", "Given the hours and reams of media coverage of the death of Queen Elizabeth II in recent days, it's almost surprising to learn that her funeral on Monday is still a mystery to millions in the USA.  Nevertheless, the gods of Google insist multiple questions are trending about the funeral.

That procession, led by King Charles III and his siblings, will look very much like the procession to take the coffin from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Hall on Wednesday, but shorter.

Codenamed “Operation London Bridge,” arrangements for Britain’s longest-serving monarch have been carefully pored over for years by the many agencies involved, with the Queen herself signing off on every single detail before her death. However, these details were kept under wraps until the sitting sovereign, King Charles III, gave it all his final seal of approval.

On Sunday morning, gamekeepers carried it to a waiting hearse, and then the beloved monarch left Balmoral for the last time.

NBC dropped the 2022 Globes broadcast  after a contingent of powerful publicists boycotted the organization and some studios — including Netflix and WarnerMedia — cut ties after The Times’ investigation.", "And more than 100 Hollywood publicity firms called on the association to “eradicate the longstanding exclusionary ethos and pervasive practice of discriminatory behavior, unprofessionalism, ethical impropriety and alleged financial corruption.” Until the group made its plans for change public, the firms said, they would not advise their clients to engage with the group’s journalists. Now that the organization has outlined its plans for reform, publicists and agents say that some stars are open to participating, while others want the Globes to be permanently retired.

We have a great team in place to grow this iconic brand and captivate new and existing audiences to celebrate the very best in television and motion pictures.” The ceremony is currently scheduled for January 7, though there is not yet a broadcast partner for the awards show. It could feasibly end up on a major network or a streaming platform, as was the case for the SAG Awards, which aired live on Netflix’s  YouTube page earlier this year. On February 21, 2021, a Los Angeles Times investigation accused the HFPA of “self-dealing” and highlighted potential conflicts of interest.

She shared her appreciation at getting the chance to play this role, and even revealed the name of her character. \"Very proud to represent my fellow middle eastern brothers and sisters as Adrianna,\" Shahi wrote. DC fans will recognize the name Adrianna and associate it with Adrianna Tomaz, Black Adam's wife and the hero Isis. You can see Shahi's full post down below. Adrianna has long been rumored to be a part of Black Adam, so it isn't too surprising that Shahi is actually playing her. However, her role as Adrianna seemingly also confirms the film will feature Isis. In the comics, Adrianna possess the Amulet of Isis, which bestows her with the powers of the goddess. It would make sense for Black Adam to show Adrianna in her superpowered form, perhaps suiting up alongside her husband for an epic battle. Of course, there are bound to be some changes in how Black Adam depicts Adrianna. For one thing, superhero movies these days are always putting some new spins on characters. For another, Shahi's initial casting described her character as \"a university professor and freedom fighter leading the resistance in Kahndaq.", "Whether because of the often complex rights issues surrounding the Shazam franchise or the fact that demon-possessed supervillains can be a tough sell in all-ages superhero fare, Sabbac hasn't appeared much outside of DC's comic book line. The character receives a mention (along with Ibac) in an episode of the animated series Young Justice. Sabbac's second host, Ishmael Gregor, appears as a recurring villain in Arrow: Season 5, but strictly in his role as a gangster from Oliver Queen's checkered past.  Sabbac will finally make his proper, live-action debut in the Black Adam movie, with Aladdin's Marwan Kenzari cast as Ishmael Gregor. Thanks to a leaked McFarlane Toys action figure, we know this version of Gregor is depicted as the leader of Intergang, one of the dominant criminal organizations in the DCU. But whereas Intergang is normally known for harnessing advanced weaponry and tech against heroes like Superman, it seems Gregor is turning to the supernatural realm in his fight against Black Adam and the Justice Society.   It's pretty clear already that the DCEU version of Sabbac isn't a particularly close adaptation of any of the comic book incarnations. He may instead draw elements from all three. Like Timothy Karnes, this version of Gregor may turn out to be a member of a family with centuries-old ties to Sabbac.", "Over the years, she's had supporting roles in Person of Interest, Chicago Fire, and City on a Hill.

The Quantum Leap reboot series will star Top Gun: Maverick actor Raymond Lee in the lead role. The cult science-fiction TV show Quantum Leap was a television staple in the late '80s and '90s. Starring Scott Bakula as Dr. Sam Beckett, a scientist who inadvertently leaps through spacetime during time travel experiments, the show became a huge success and ran for five seasons and 97 episodes on NBC. The show was hugely influential, blending the genres of sci-fi, romance, drama, and social commentary, and remains one of the most influential TV shows ever. Following rumors of a possible remake or continuation, NBC greenlit an hour-long pilot, also called Quantum Leap, in January 2022. According to Deadline, Lee, who has previously appeared in episodes of Modern Family and How I Met Your Mother, will play the lead role of Dr. Ben Seong, a world-famous physicist working on a time travel project known as Quantum Leap.

Sadly, while it stands tall next to its RTX 4090 sibling, it’s probably not the 80-class successor you’ve been waiting for, as it flies a bit too close to the premium price point sun.   The best graphics card battlefield currently feels a bit topsy-turvy, as AMD’s top GPU, the Radeon RX 7900 XTX, is actually an RTX 4080 rival that costs $899 USD. I can’t say for sure whether the RDNA 3 card will use the Lovelace card’s lofty price against it, but it’s certainly worth keeping in mind while judging Nvidia’s contender.    The RTX 4080, however, comes in at $1,199 USD / £1,269 GBP – $500 more than the RTX 3080 at launch.

Our full benchmark results won’t be posted until our final RTX 4080 review launches in the next day or two—a burst pipe in the middle of the night foiled my release-day ambitions—but at a high level, it’s about 30 percent faster than the RTX 3080 at 4K resolution with settings maxed out and ray tracing/DLSS off. That’s a solid, if unspectacular generational jump (the RTX 4090’s 55 to 83 percent leap over the 3090 was much more impressive, as was the 3080 vs. 2080), the sort you’d expect to see in the same class moving from one gen to the next. But that’s at the same price. Again, Nvidia is asking for 71 percent more cash for that mere 30 percent uplift—$699 versus $1,199. At the same $1,199 price, the RTX 4080 is only faster than the RTX 3080 Ti by single-digit percentages. That’s absolutely insane and aggressively insulting to PC gamers. You should stay far, far away from this graphics card at this price.  There are wider economic reasons why Nvidia probably priced the RTX 4080 this way.", "The RTX 4090 is available at most major retailers in the US, but you shouldn’t expect a cheap price anywhere, as no matter what card you choose, you’ll be paying at least $1599. On the higher-end of the AIB cards, especially the ASUS ROG Strix OC’d model, you could pay up to around $2000 in total. Though, some of these premium cards can now be found at a slight discount, if you are lucky.  If you’re looking for an RTX 4090 prebuilt PC, retailer B&H has already equipped itself with all manner of configurations for you to purchase. However, expect to spend around $4000 on a brand-new PC of this caliber, as the rest of the parts will also be fairly high-end.  The RTX 4090 is priced at an MSRP of $1599. However, in current listings, you should expect this number to vary from $1599, all the way to around $2000 for the higher-end AIB models from brands such as ASUS.

Rubio, 51, faced perhaps his toughest battle since he was first elected in 2010 after serving as the Florida House speaker. Once a presidential hopeful in 2016, Rubio’s name is less often mentioned as a potential 2024 candidate. WATCH LIVE: 2022 Midterm Elections | PBS NewsHour Special Coverage Rubio ran a campaign pulled from the Republican playbook, tying Demings to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and President Joe Biden and hammering her on issues like spending, rising inflation and a crisis at the southern border. The Republican was helped by shifting voter registration numbers in Florida. The last time Rubio ran for reelection, Democrats had about 327,000 more registered voters than Republicans. That has since flipped, with the GOP now having a nearly 300,000 advantage over Democrats.", "Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

We added some really beautiful bows and satin with little trains coming off. It was really kind of the perfect combination of something that was fun, but also special and classic.” Ten of O’Neill’s team members also worked on the dress, which featured hand-done beadwork that was hand-sewn onto the bodice. “We worked really closely together on this,” she added.

What country has the best odds to go the distance? Which player will be the breakout star of the tournament? Who will win the Golden Boot? What about the Golden Ball? Will there be a “Hand of God”-like on-field controversy that defines the tournament for years to come? Why do we watch this stupid sport — which always seems to break our hearts — anyway?  But perhaps the most interesting (if often futile!) question of all is: Which group is the tournament’s Group of Death? It’s a fun question, one that has the ability to drum up plenty of controversy (and make some wonder if the Group of Death is actually just a myth). But if you’re looking for clear answers, you probably won’t find any this time around.   Is it Group B — featuring England, Iran, the U.S. and Wales — which has the highest average world ranking as defined by FIFA? What about Group E, which features two of the past three winners (Spain and Germany) alongside two plucky underdogs — Costa Rica and Japan — with sneaky high world rankings of their own?", "But it remains to be seen how well the Samurai Blue will fare when they come up against stronger opposition in the knockouts.

Sports scientists and mathematicians have spent years studying the best and fairest ways to organise tournaments.

The most frequent criticism of FIFA’s draws for World Cup groups is that they tend to produce groups of unequal strength. Some may get a comparatively easy ride through the group stage while others could find themselves in a “group of death”. Organisers need to make sure strong teams aren’t penalised for their strength, while avoiding the emergence of any weak groups, to maintain fairness and keep TV audiences riveted.  FIFA’s seeding system assigns the host nation and the seven strongest teams to each of the eight groups. To guarantee a geographical spread, it defines six qualifying zones: Africa, Asia, Europe, North and Central America, with the Caribbean, Oceania and South America in the final pot. No two teams from the same zone – except Europe – can be in the same group, while no more than two European teams can be in the same group. At first glance, this year’s draw seems pretty even-handed.

The German team looked to be in cruise control for 75 minutes until substitute Ritsu Doan brought Japan level against the flow of the game.

This was the second successive time that Germany, four-time champions, crashed out of the FIFA World Cup in the group stage - a big surprise considering their superpower status in the game and the abundance of talented players in their team. There are some interesting parallels in the unceremonious exits.

Microsoft 365 Basic will be available worldwide on January 30th with 100GB of cloud storage, an ad-free Outlook web and mobile experience, and enhanced security features. The security features include data encryption for an Outlook mailbox, suspicious link checking, and virus / malware scanning for attachments. Existing OneDrive 100GB storage customers will be automatically upgraded to Microsoft 365 Basic at the same $1.99 monthly rate. “Later this year, we’ll have a bunch of stuff with OneDrive advanced security that will be available as well, that includes Personal Vault, password-protected and expiring links, ransomware detection and recovery, and bulk file restore,” says Gareth Oystryk, director of product marketing for Microsoft 365, in an interview with The Verge.

Midjourney, he said, is pretty small right now. \"We're like about 10 people,\" he explained. \"We're self-funded. We have no investors. We're not really financially motivated. We're just sort of here to work on things we're passionate about and have fun. And we were working on a lot of different projects.\" Holz said the technological aspect of AI and the extent to which it will improve is fairly easy to foresee. \"But the human ramifications of that are so hard to imagine,\" he said. \"There's something here that's at the intersection of humanity and technology. In order to really figure out what this is and what it should be, we really need to do a lot of experiments.\" The unsettled nature of AI image technology is evident in the difference between tools like Midjourney and a downloadable open source graphics application like Blender, or a locally installed commercial application like Adobe Photoshop (before it became a cloud service). Midjourney exists in a social context. Its front-end is the chat service Discord. New users log in to Discord's Midjourney server and can then submit text prompts to generate images alongside numerous other users in any of the various newbie channels. The resulting images for all the users in that channel surface in about a minute, which helps reinforce the notion of community.", "As the technology goes mainstream, though, one company will be able to take some credit for its ascendancy: a 10-person research lab named Midjourney, which makes an eponymous AI image generator accessed through a Discord chat server. Although the name might be unfamiliar, you’ve probably seen the output from Midjourney’s system floating about your social media feeds already. To generate your own, you just join Midjourney’s Discord, type a prompt, and the system makes an image for you.  Midjourney exists on Discord because “people want to make things together” “A lot of people ask us, why don’t you just make an iOS app that makes you a picture?” Midjourney’s founder, David Holz, told The Verge in an interview. “But people want to make things together, and if you do that on iOS, you have to make your own social network. And that’s pretty hard. So if you want your own social experience, Discord is really great.” Sign up for a free account, and you get 25 credits, with all images generated in public chatrooms. After that, you’ll have to pay — either $10 or $30 a month, depending on the number of images you want to make and whether or not they’re private to you.  This week, though, Midjourney is expanding access to its model, allowing anyone to create their own Discord server with their own AI image generator.", "10] On November 5, 2022, the alpha iteration of version 4 was released to users[11][12] and on March 15, 2023, the alpha iteration of version 5 was released.[13] The 5.1 model is more 'opinionated' than version 5, applying more of its own stylization to images, while the 5.1 RAW model adds improvement while working better with more literal prompts.  Midjourney is currently only accessible through a Discord bot on their official Discord server, by direct messaging the bot, or by inviting the bot to a third party server. To generate images, users use the /imagine command and type in a prompt; the bot then returns a set of four images. Users may then choose which images they want to upscale. Midjourney is also working on a web interface.[17]  Founder David Holz says he sees artists as customers, not competitors of Midjourney. Holz told The Register that artists use Midjourney for rapid prototyping of artistic concepts to show to clients before starting work themselves.[5] Some artists have accused Midjourney of devaluing original creative work by using it in the training set;[18] Midjourney's terms of service includes a DMCA takedown policy, allowing artists to request their work to be removed from the set if they believe copyright infringement to be evident.[19]", "Mohammad Emad Mostaque (Bengali: মোহম্মদ ইমাদ মোশতাক) is the founder and CEO of Stability AI, one of the companies behind Stable Diffusion.", "Mohammad Emad Mostaque  (Bengali: মোহম্মদ ইমাদ মোশতাক) is the founder and CEO of Stability AI, one of the companies behind Stable Diffusion.[2][4][5][6]  Mostaque was born on April 1983 to a Bengali Muslim family in Jordan.

This is really a remarkable conversation: toys are a big, complex business.  Okay, Chris Cocks, CEO of Hasbro. Here we go. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity. Chris Cocks, you are the CEO of Hasbro. Welcome to Decoder. Nilay, thank you so much for having me. I’m really excited to talk to you. You’re the final episode in our Centennial Series. Oh, wow.  We’re talking to the executives of companies that are over 100 years old, and Hasbro just hit the mark this year. That’s pretty exciting. It has come a long way from where it started. I will tell you, I did not know that the name Hasbro is literally the Has brothers.  Hassenfeld brothers, yeah. It’s very good that they were like, “We’re bros,” in 1923.

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly Sept 23 (Reuters) - Burberry (BRBY.L) finance chief Julie Brown will step down in April after more than five years in the role, the latest change of guard at the British luxury brand as it struggles to keep up with rivals. The 60-year-old British national, who joined the company in 2017 from medical products maker Smith & Nephew (SN.L), will also leave her role as chief operating officer and will take up an opportunity in a different industry, Burberry said on Friday. Brown's departure comes after former CEO Marco Gobbetti, the mastermind of a multi-year plan to reposition Burberry, jumped ship earlier this year after around five years in the role, and new boss Jonathan Akeroyd faces the challenge of steering the brand's sales to pre-pandemic levels. \"(Brown) has played a key role in positioning Burberry for growth ... I look forward to building on the strong foundations we have in place to realise Burberry's full potential,\" Akeroyd said in a statement.", "Chris’s extensive omni-channel experience and proven track record make him the ideal leader for Hasbro as it continues to become the world’s leading play and entertainment company.

A storyteller and gamer at heart, Chris innately understands how to create and nurture brands to drive fan and consumer connection across channels. He is a highly strategic leader, with the vision, skills and experience to unlock our Brand Blueprint for supercharged growth.”   Mr. Cocks said: “Hasbro has amazing brands, gifted storytellers and unique entertainment assets, and I am humbled to step into the position of CEO at this important time and to build on the strong foundation Brian created. Our consumer products, gaming and entertainment teams are the best and most creative in the business and have shown such incredible resilience.

Next to him in the final group Sunday was Rickie Fowler, a Southern California native who returned from a three-year slump and was poised to finally win his first major. Clark carried a message from his late mother — “Play big,” she always told him — and the belief he could compete with anyone on any stage. No stage was bigger than a U.S. Open on the edge of Beverly Hills. That’s where Clark delivered clutch saves, a signature shot that gave him control and the steady nerves to hold off McIlroy and become a major champion. “I feel like I belong on this stage,” Clark said after closing with an even-par 70 for a one-shot victory over McIlroy. “Even two, three years ago when people didn’t know who I was, I felt like I could still play and compete against the best players in the world.", "Jun 18, 2023 ...

After aggravating the sprained ankle he suffered three weeks ago Sunday, the All-Pro quarterback led the Kansas City Chiefs to a thrilling 38-35 come-from-behind victory over the Philadelphia Eagles to hoist his second Lombardi Trophy and earn Super Bowl MVP honors. The league's MVP finished with 182 yards passing and three touchdowns. He also had 44 yards rushing, including a 26-yard sprint with just over 2 minutes left in a 35-all game as Kansas City was driving for the winning score. Harrison Butker put the Chiefs on top with his 27-yard field goal with 8 seconds to go. “He’s the MVP,” Chiefs coach Andy Reid said about Mahomes. “That’s all that needs to be said: MVP.” Mahomes reinjured his ankle late in the first half when Eagles linebacker T.J.

After the Kansas City Chiefs completed their storybook season by defeating the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl 57, the identity of the Super Bowl MVP was the only question that remained unanswered. Winning a Super Bowl is a team effort, but only one player can be awarded the Pete Rozelle Trophy, given annually to the Super Bowl MVP. The Super Bowl MVP award was won by Patrick Mahomes. This is the second Super Bowl MVP of Mahomes’ career, as he also won the award after defeating the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl 54. Mahomes and the rest of Kansas City’s offense struggled in the first half. The Chiefs controlled the ball for only eight minutes and six seconds, posted just 20 offensive plays, gained six first downs, and scored one offensive touchdown, an 18-yard pass from Mahomes to Travis Kelce. Mahomes came into the game with a high ankle sprain suffered in Kansas City’s Divisional Round win over the Jaguars, and he seemingly aggravated the injury just before halftime. Taken down on a scramble attempt, Mahomes limped back to the Chiefs’ sideline before writhing in pain. And yet, Mahomes returned after halftime and looked like the player we’ve all come to know.

Given the challenging macro backdrop, others are more cautious. Rosenblatt Securities recently offered a $106 target which is less than 10% upside. Whether Amazon soars or merely inches higher from here will depend on two questions: 1) will inflation and rates cool enough to spur a significant revival in online shopping activity, and 2) will an improved economic outlook push more enterprises to spend on Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure?", "It’s highly unlikely that this herd of bulls has the long-term forecast wrong.  There’s a big jump down to the MATANA stock with the next best upside, and that’s Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The Street’s $292 target implies 13% upside, slightly ahead of Apple’s projected gain. Microsoft’s run from here may be limited because the stock has already bounced 20% off its November 2022 low. Microsoft's rally has come at the hands of two major catalysts. First, better-than-expected December quarter earnings suggested an inflection point is near regarding sluggish Windows, Office and Azure spending. For the current quarter, analysts anticipate 11% bottom-line growth, which would be the highest in five quarters.  Second, the company’s aggressive push into conversational AI has demonstrated leadership in this emerging technology. Microsoft recently announced that its Edge and Bing browsers would come with AI chat functionality similar to ChatGPT in which it has invested $10 billion.  Based on the sharp year-to-date advance (and technical indicators such as MACD), Microsoft could probably have a better entry point. If the stock revisits the $230 level, this would be a more favorable entry — especially considering $220 has proven to be reliable support.

But one thing the latest Apple event sparked was a reaction for a much lesser known company – Globalstar Inc (NYSE:GSAT). The Louisiana-based satellite company, it was announced, has entered into a partnership with Apple to provide users of the iPhone 14 Pro with emergency services via direct-to-satellite communications. The iPhone 14 Pro is equipped with an antenna that will give users the ability to connect to satellite frequencies to use a text-based service to communicate their location in case of emergency in areas without cell service. The announcement resulted in Globalstar stock soaring last Wednesday, hitting a high on the day of $2.28. It, however, quickly retraced from that high, hitting a low the following day of $1.66. It closed the week on Friday at $1.77. Globalstar Weekly Chart Source: Investing.com The initial roller coaster effect was based purely on a knee-jerk reaction to the announcement by Apple. The stock's failure to launch in any sustainable upward movement, however, is more a reflection of reality.

Nvidia led the way with an impressive 343% increase in its stock price, followed by Tesla with a 276% increase. Amazon has been the only company with negative figures over these 3 years, reflecting a -5% performance. However, it has shown slight signs of recovery from mid-2022 until June 29, 2023, achieving a gain of 12%. It is worth mentioning that the excessive surge in Nvidia’s stock price has been driven by its leadership in the artificial intelligence industry. This has led the company to reach the milestone of one trillion dollars in market capitalization in early June 2023, becoming the seventh US company to achieve this feat, which is quite impressive for the renowned gaming GPU company. According to a report from Nasdaq, the best company in the MATANA group for long-term investment is Alphabet. In February 2023, Wall Street maintained a unanimous stance on buying Alphabet shares, with 32 analyst firms promoting its “purchase”.

The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve Jobs, after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts. Seeing a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in 1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship with consumers and hired Ron Johnson in 2000. Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997 and opened the first two physical stores in 2001. The media initially speculated that Apple would fail, but its stores were highly successful, bypassing the sales numbers of competing nearby stores and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the fastest retailer in history to do so.
