The Gist: In 1970, Taylor and King performed their first concert together at the famed Troubadour club in Hollywood. It was the beginning of a beautiful – 100 percent platonic! – friendship in which they made beautiful music together, and I’m sorry for the cliches, but in this case, they’re true. They sang each other’s songs, encouraged and complemented each other, and harmonized like tea and honey. Forty years later, they decided to celebrate their convergence with a 50-plus-date tour, and now, 12 years after that, we get a celebration of the celebration, a remembrance of a remembrance that brought so much joy to so many people 52 years ago and then again 12 years ago, and now again a third time officially, with this movie.

At the genesis of their now 50 years of friendship and collaboration, six-time Grammy® Award-winner James Taylor and four-time Grammy® Award-winner Carole King, famously performed together in 1970 at The Troubadour, the storied Los Angeles club. The pair came together to reprise that concert for The Troubadour's own 50th anniversary in 2007.  As Taylor recalls in the film, those 2007 performances including \"So Far Away,\" \"I Feel the Earth Move,\" and \"You've Got a Friend,\" during six sold out concerts, were so much fun, that he and King hatched plans for a 2010 world tour.

So, to celebrate the start of the summer season and to help spark some inspiration of what to do (or not do) on your next trip, we’ve put together our list of the all-time best road-trip movies.   Alright, so technically, this isn’t a summer road-trip movie, considering it’s one of the few films set during Thanksgiving, but it’s still the all-time best buddy adventure film.

And that, in turn, has helped him thrive in coaching. “Being able to establish relationships came naturally to me, and it was important to me, and it has allowed me to get to where I’m at today,” Semore said. It’s an experience he wouldn’t trade either.

On the other hand, offense is more execution and assignment based. Defense has those principals, but it’s based on effort and technique.” He said his father, Russ, who coached him at Ganado High, inspired him to go into coaching. The elder Semore went to Ganado High and returned after college and the military to start a coaching career. And after graduating from Ganado, Jason went on to play college football at Adams State University in Colorado. His coaching stops have included Adams State, the Colorado School of Mines, the University of Tulsa, Oklahoma State University, the University of Montana, Temple University, Valdosta State University and Georgia Tech.  He was not drafted into the NFL after college, and said he modeled his style of play on the football field after linebackers Dan Morgan of the Carolina Panthers and Hall of Famer and native New Mexican Brian Urlacher of the Chicago Bears. “My father was my inspiration,” Jason said. “He taught me the value of team and about being a part of something bigger than myself.
